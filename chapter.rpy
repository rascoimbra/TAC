DAY 2
Once again, the silence of the apartment is shattered at 6:00 AM. Before Jessica can stop the alarm on her phone, Conner's arm reaches past and switches the alarm off.
*sigh* I wonder when he got home last night. This better not be a regular thing. First day at the center, and he's already showing up late.
Conner plants a kiss on Jessica's forehead before firmly pulling her body into his own.
Mmmm...
I was in the mood for this last night. I'm not anymore.
Jessica tries to push the man away and get out of bed, but finds herself held in place by the man's arms.
I have to get ready for work.
Come on, just a few minutes. I just want to lay here with you.
Well, I have to get ready. Come on, let go.
Hey, I'm sorry.
We were supposed to celebrate my new job last night...
I know, I know.
The veteran's center was incredibly busy, and I stupidly offered this guy a ride to his nephew's place. I ended up having to drive a hundred miles to a nearby town.
Ugh. Seriously? You couldn't have just told him no?
Not then. I'd already agreed to it.
Jesus, Conner.
I'm sorry, babe. Let me make it up to you. We'll go out tonight, hit up a club. We'll have a night just for you.
Unless you have to drive someone else.
I promise. Nothing will keep me from you tonight.
With a sigh, Jessica lifts her head and kisses him on the lips.
Well, since you promised.
Conner kisses her in return before nodding to her nightstand.
I see you and your friend enjoyed yourselves while I was gone.
Jessica's head turns back, spotting the vibrator she'd left sitting out the previous evening.
Jessica quickly grabs up the sex toy, slapping it back into place in the nightstand and slamming the drawer shut.
Oh my god. I can't believe I left that out. And I can't believe I thought about Heather.
Geez, it probably still smells like me.
Just... just forget you saw that.
Whoops. I wonder how that got out.
Hehehe. Yeah, I wonder.
Just... just forget you saw that.
Conner hugs her close from behind, planting a kiss on the nape of her neck.
Hey, it's not your fault you were alone last night. I'm just sorry you had to go to Mr. Buzz-Buzz for some quality time.
Jessica chuckles, a smile crossing her face as she relaxes, savoring the feeling of Conner's lips on her neck.
First off, his name is Armand.
Second, as nice as that feels, I need to get going.
She quickly finds her top among the sheets and puts it on. Her panties are on the floor next to the bed.
I should stop throwing my underwear around the room. I'm not alone anymore.
I'm gonna go jogging with Heather.
Alright.
Jessica grasps the toy, turning back to Conner before she begins to plant soft, teasing kisses along its length.
What can I say? He always takes care of me. Never has to drive someone to his nephew's.
Hehehe. Well, now he's making me jealous.
Will it help if I say that every time I was with him, I was thinking of you?
A warm smile slips across Conner's face. He leans in to kiss Jessica, but as he does so she slips from the bed, placing the vibrator back in its drawer.
I've got to get going.
She quickly finds her top among the sheets and puts it on. Her panties are on the floor next to the bed.
I should stop throwing my underwear around the room, I'm not alone anymore.
I'm gonna go jogging with Heather. She'll be waiting for me.
Alright.
Jessica heads into the bathroom, washing her face and brushing her teeth.
*sigh* I just can't be mad at him. I'm too happy he's back.
I'm still gonna have to hold this over him for a while. I don't want to have to rely on my vibrator when I should have Conner's big dick instead.
Hopefully it won't happen again. I'm sure he'll get used to handling the people at his new job soon enough.
Heading back out to the kitchen, Jessica finds Conner having laid out breakfast for her.
Hey, babe. I made pancakes.
Mmmmm...
It looks delicious.
Sit down. Dig in.
Well, it's a small start in making up for last night. Keep it up and I just might forgive you.
Oooh, you're so vindictive. You're gonna make one hell of a reporter if you're this tenacious.
Jessica playfully sticks out her tongue before digging into her pancakes.
Oh my god. It's so good!
It's the only thing I can do. So I thought I may as well get good at it.
...
Mmm-mmph. Hmm? What?
Hah. Nothing. It's just... you remind me of the guys in my unit - taking huge bites and chewing with a full mouth.
*gulp* Well, it's good. Plus, I have to get jogging and get to work.
I know. I gotta head out soon too. I'm gonna go get ready.
Mmm-kay.
Jessica sprays a few bits of pancake from between her lips as she speaks with her mouth full.
Conner chuckles as he rises, heading off to the bathroom to shave and freshen up.
Finishing her breakfast, Jessica puts her dish in the sink and heads back to the bedroom.
After dressing for her run, she returns to the living room, ready to burn the calories off her slender body.
Alright, I'm heading out, sweetie. You're leaving soon?
*gulp* Yeah, babe. I'll finish eating, then get going.
I love you.
I love you too, babe. Have a great day at work.
You too, sweetie.
Jessica heads over to her neighbor's apartment, knocking on the door and waiting just a moment before Heather emerges.
Hey, Jess. Looking as great as ever, I see.
Aw, you're sweet. You're looking amazing today too.
No wonder I have such wild dreams about her, she's gorgeous.
Thanksâ€¦ You ok?
*cough* Yes, sorry, I just thought about something.
Mhm. You ready to go?
Thanks. You ready to go?
Oh yeah. Evil calories must die.
Don't I know it? Alright, let's go.
The pair head out of the building, chatting as they descend the front steps.
So, how're things going today?
I'm good. Happy to have Conner back home.
Really? You seem a little tense.
Well, we were supposed to celebrate my new job last night, but he came home late. I was already asleep when he got in.
Ain't that the way with men? God forbid they take the time for our accomplishments.
The two picked up their pace, beginning their jog as they head off toward the park.
I mean, it's not entirely his fault. He offered to help a guy get home, but it turned out he lived a hundred miles away.
What? Why didn't he tell him no?!
You're preaching to the choir. I spent all night waiting for a good dicking, and ended up having to resort to using Armand.
Armand? Oh. Haha. I see.
Yeah. Rain or shine, he's always there for me.
I totally get it. There've been more than a few times I've had to rely on Fabian, Logan, and Maria to get me to sleep.
Wait. One of them's named \"Maria\"?
*shrug* What can I say. Sometimes a girl likes to fantasize about... something different, and she needs a woman's touch.
Jessica blushes, saying nothing and changing the subject.
Um... anyway, how's work going.
Not bad. Lots of paperwork, reading through legal texts, discussing strategy. Being a lawyer's a lot more about preparation than it is spending time in the courtroom.
Sounds complicated.
There's a reason the Bar Exam is so difficult, and so many of the applicants fail it.
Working on anything interesting?
Nothing I'm supposed to talk about, but... we have a divorce case with this movie director who was screwing every woman he saw but his wife. We're gonna eat him alive.
That's off the record, though, Ms. Reporter.
I heard nothing, Ms. Lawyer.
How about you? How's the job?
I like the place. Not much to say at this point. Still getting used to everything.
Well, I hope it goes well. And if you ever need a lawyer, I'm just a phone call away.
Thanks, Heather. I'll keep that in mind.
They continue jogging for about a half an hour in the park.
*pant* *pant* *pant* Okay, what's say, *pant*, we take a break?
*pant* *pant* Good idea.
The pair head over to a nearby bench, stretching as they catch their breath.
Whew. Jessica, you've got to tell me your secret.
Huh? What secret?
How in the hell do you manage to keep so thin while keeping those boobs so big?
Jessica smiles, blushing.
Um...
Seriously. Your waist is so slim I feel like I could grip it one-handed, but your boobs stay so freaking big. I hate you.
I'm so jealous! Not to mention these thighs!
Heather places her hand on Jessica's leg, squeezing through the leggings.
God. Even your legs are perfect.
Aww, that's... that's really nice to you to say, Heather.
Aww, that's... umm...
Well, it's true. I mean, I know those bad girls aren't fake, so how do they stay so plump is beyond me.
Plus, they're gravity defying. You made a deal with the devil to never see any droopage, didn't you?
Oh, come on. They're not that perfect.
Oh really? I'm guessing when you first met Conner, he couldn't take his eyes off them.
*giggle* Yeah. He spent the whole first date talking to my chest.
Well, I can tell you every woman we've passed by today instantly hated you because of this body.
*shrug* What can I say? Life had been good to me. Good genes, good boyfriend, good job.
Sure, rub it in, bitch.
Hahaha. Rub what in? The fact that I'm gonna have back pains when I'm older?
No, I'm saying don't rub your huge tits in my face... until we're alone.
Oh, pfft.
Jessica slapps the other woman's shoulder, both of them laughing.
You're the worst!
I know.
Wow. I didn't know a woman could blush that red.
Sorry. I'm just... not used to getting complimented like that. Except by creepy men.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel bad.
Oh, oh, no. You didn't. You really, really didn't. You actually made me feel really pretty.
Oh yeah?
Yeah. I appreciate the compliments.
I'm just speaking the truth. Ain't no woman that wouldn't want a bod like that.
Heather points at her own chest.
I mean, I've always been proud of my chest, but compared to you, I might as well be flat.
Jessica's eyes flits to her friend's breasts, thoughts of Heather's bare bosoms causing a light tingle in her loins.
She shifts slightly, hoping to hide the fact that she'd become so aroused by thoughts of her friend.
Oh, there's nothing wrong with your tits, believe me. They're freaking gorgeous, Heather.
Really? You think so?
Oh yeah. I... caught Conner staring at them more than once.
I'm surprised he can take his eyes away from your tits to see anyone else's. They're so big, they blot out the sun!
The pair shares a hearty laugh, Jessica wiping away tears of laughter.
Well, he is fond of them.
Oh yeah? He does a lot of fondling in bed?
Oh yeah.
Heather leanes in, whispering to Jessica.
Titfucking?
*nod* Among other things.
I honestly wish Christian would try that with me. Fortunately, he's good with his tongue.
Really? How good?
Like Gene Simmons cross-bred with a snake good.
Oh my god!
Yeah. I've told him before, jokingly (kinda), that he shouldn't talk in bed, since there's so much more he could do with his tongue.
Wow. I'm jealous. Conner's not really into using his tongue that much.
It's the best. You two should try it.
Eh. Usually, the two of us are more interested in getting to the main event.
Thankfully, he's..., um, a nice big soldier boy, with a soldier's stamina.
Oooh.
I think maybe we should talk about something else. I'm getting a little wet.
I understand. Talking about your well-hung man can do that.
Jessica's eyes momentarily snapped back to Heather's breasts.
Yeah, d-definitely.
The pair soon continue their jog, arriving back at their apartment building.
Alright. I gotta grab a shower and then head off to work.
Hey, question for ya before you head off. I was wondering if you and Conner would like to have dinner with us tonight.
Oh, I'd love to, but we already have plans. Conner's taking me out tonight as an apology to showing up late last night.
I understand. I hope you two have a wonderful evening together, and he goes well out of his way to make up for standing you up.
Yeah, me too. I really want to spend some time together.
I understand. I'd want to be alone too, given how long you two have been apart. Get some time together in the sack.
Believe me, it's been on my mind constantly.
I'll bet. Do you have any panties you haven't soaked lately?
Not really. He gets my motor running, that's for sure.
Well, what about tomorrow evening? Would you two be free then?
Yeah! I'd still need to run it by Conner, but I'm pretty sure he'd be down.
Awesome! Alright, I'll see you two tomorrow then. I'll call and we'll hash out the details.
Alright. Have a great day, Heather!
After heading back up to her apartment and squeezing in a quick shower, Jessica dresses for work.
Putting up her hair, checking her makeup, going over herself once more to make sure everything's in place. Then she grabs her keys and heads off.
On her way, Jessica soon passes by Mr. Parker's newsstand, noticing the older gentleman next to a few boxes.
He bends over slowly to pick one up, a hand on his clearly aching back.
I really wish he had someone to help him out. He's getting a little too old to be working all alone like that.
Maybe I should give him a hand. I'll be late, but I'm sure he'd appreciate a bit of help.
I should give him a hand.
*sigh* Unfortunately, I'm cutting it close enough as it is. I just don't have time to help him out today.
Jessica waves at him as she rides by, a smile lighting up the man's face as he sees the pretty young lady.
Good morning, Mr. Parker!
Good morning, Jessica!
The young woman continues on her way, feeling a little guilty that she couldn't do more but eager not to be late on her second day at work.
Pulling her scooter over, Jessica takes off her helmet and walks over to help Mr. Parker with his morning deliveries.
Hey, Mr. Parker.
Jessica! Good morning! How are you today?
Pretty good. Can I offer you some help?
Oh, that's kind of you, Jessica, but I think I can get it. No need to bother yourself.
Oh, it's no bother. Come on. Let me help move these inside.
Ah, Jessica. If I was ten years younger, there's no way I could accept, but... ah... this old back means this old man ain't quite as quick as he used to be.
Jessica immediately bends down and grabs one of the boxes, moving it into the shack before coming out for the other two.
Are these newspapers?
No, the newspapers arrive early. Just some magazines.
There we go.
Thanks so much, Jessica. I appreciate it.
Well, why don't I get these put up on the shelves? You can just take a rest.
Oh, Jessica, no. You've done more than enough.
Really, it's no trouble. At all.
Jessica opens the boxes, pulling out the contents and arranging them according to Mr. Parker's directions.
So, how's the new job going?
Well, not much has happened, really. They had me transcribing interviews the whole day.
Don't worry, it's a rite of passage. I made Duncan sift through old articles for two weeks before I sent him to do his first interview.
Sometimes it's hard to believe that this gentle old man used to be one of the best journalists in New Port, before he quit some 10 years ago.
Well, I hope they're not as cruel as you.
Hahaha! No, not Duncan. See, Birch is another story.
Yeah, I got the whole \"my word is the word of god\" speech.
Of course you did. Don't let him scare you, he'll give you your freedom. You just have to earn it.
A good journalist must be headstrong, even if that clashes with his editor. And he knows that. Show him you're capable and you'll have his respect.
The journalistic profession is all about results - the end product is what the audience sees. And he's the kind of guy who values results.
Besides, impactful articles sell papers. As part of the chain I'm also counting on you.
I'll do my best not to disappoint then.
Jessica gives him a warm smile and heads over to put the magazines in their new spot, bending over slightly as she put them in place.
Heading back to the box to retrieve more copies, she notices out of the corner of her eyes that Mr. Parker's head is turned and his body bent slightly to the side.
Is he... checking out my ass? Really?
I'm a little surprised a man his age would still do things like that. What should I do?
Well, I think I should go. That's enough ogling for today.
There. That's... those are in place. I actually really should go. I'm gonna be late.
Of course. Thank you so much for your help, Jessica. I really appreciate it.
No problem, Mr. Parker. You have a wonderful day.
Heading back over to her moped, Jessica jumps on and takes off, feeling a little perturbed at being eye-banged by an old man, especially after she helped him out like that.
Oh well. I guess men will be men.
You dirty old man, checking out a girl a third of your age.
As Jessica positions another magazine on the small shelf, she leans in even further, intentionally sticking her shapely bottom out farther than she has to.
Huh. Did he just draw in a breath when I stuck my ass out at him? He really is a horny old man.
I'm seriously surprised. I would have figured at his age he was done ogling young girls like me.
Then again, maybe he gets bored in here and checking out pretty girls is one of the ways he keeps himself entertained.
There. We'll just get this pushed in here, well out of the way.
The young woman took one of the boxes and put it on the ground, sticking her ass out in the air as far as she could.
Oh, uh, my.
What?
Oh, nothing. Just mumbling to myself.
Wow, he's really enthralled. Is my ass really that amazing? Heather did seem impressed with it.
I wonder if he's just staring, or if he's imagining something else as well. Something... naughty.
Is he imagining what I'd look like without the pants on? Is he picturing my pussy?
Is he thinking about touching me? Patting my ass or... sliding his finger along my slit?
Jessica wiggles her ass back and forth ever so slightly, as if she were struggling to push the box in.
Mr. Parker exhales sharply, eyes locking onto the woman's display.
Can he get a boner at this age?
Is he tempted to pull my pants down and fuck me, sliding his old dick in my tight, young pussy?
What if... he's thinking about actually doing it?
...and why am I not more alarmed at that thought?
Jessica pulls herself back up, straightening her clothing but not yet turning back to Mr. Parker.
What the hell is wrong with me that I'm thinking like this? I've got a man like Conner back home.
Why would I have such dirty thoughts about other people when I have his dick waiting for me?
With a deep breath, Jessica turns back to Mr. Parker, the man's gaze immediately darting away from her bottom, his face flush and his hands clasped in front of him.
Wow, I made him blush.
I wonder if it's going to rain today?
Mr. Parker?
Huh? Oh, sorry, Jessica. My mind got away from me for a moment there.
Oh, that's okay. I really should get going. I'm gonna be late for work.
Of course, Jessica. Thank you so much for all your help. I really appreciate it.
It was my pleasure, Mr. Parker. Happy to help.
Feel free to come by any time and chat. I love talking with you.
I'll do just that. Let you in on any juicy scoops I come up with.
Take care now.
Bye!
Jessica walked back to her moped, swaying her hips as seductively as she could manage while appearing nonchalant.
A small smile came over her lips as she felt the old man's eyes following her along, even while she drove off down the street.
Stepping off the elevator onto her floor, Jessica strides down the hallway toward the work area.
Heading inside, she spots Eve already at her desk.
Good morning, Eve.
Bonjour, Jessica.
Already hard at work?
Yes, one must show dedication in our trade. Job security at a newspaper is shaky enough.
Right.
Sitting down at her desk, Jessica quickly organizes her things and sets herself to task, continuing the work she began the previous day.
Well, glad the first thing I hear on my second day is about the lack of job security...
I can't think about it! I'm gonna make this work, and I'll make damn sure this paper keeps me on.
Heading inside the office, Jessica strides down the hallway toward her cubicle.
At the far end, she spots Eve standing near the water cooler, the woman's short, black hair immediately identifying her.
Wow. I love her boots. Cute dress too.
Hey, Eve.
Bonjour, Jessica. How are you? Would you like a coffee?
I'd love one. Thanks.
Eve pops a couple of coins into the vending machine, the sound of hot, brewing coffee and its pleasant aroma soon filling Jessica's senses.
How are things today?
Can't complain. How about with you?
Bon. I am quite well.
Once the machine finishes working, Eve bends down, grabbing the steaming cup of coffee and handing it to Jessica.
Thanks.
So, how did your first day go? Is the job to your liking?
Well, I expected something more than transcribing someone's interviews, to be honest.
At least you're sitting on your desk. They made me sort out through old documents in the storage room for my first three days.
They gave her a similar lame task. And here I thought I was special.
I guess that's their way of saying \"Welcome to the team\".
Or \"Run while you still can\".
Hah, it could be.
Well, I hope they let us do some journalism in between the secretary work.
That's assuming they decide to keep us both.
Yeah, there's thatâ€¦
A light silence hangs between the two young women as they sip on their coffees.
Maybe you and I can prove we are indispensable to this paper.
Any ideas how?
Like me, you believe there is something wrong with the police force, oui?
That's right.
If we work together and bring in print-worthy news, we can show Monsieur Birch that we are worth keeping.
Yeah, that sounds like a good way to prove ourselves. As long as we can pull it off.
I'm confident in my skills. Aren't you?
Of course I am.
Then we can make it work. You keep an eye for an opportunity and I'll do the same.
Well, we should get to work. Let me know if you need anything, Jessica.
Thanks, Eve. I will.
Sitting down at her desk, Jessica quickly organizes her things and sets herself to task, continuing the work she began the previous day.
The morning passed with Jessica diligently typing away, unaware of Rosa's arrival until the woman's hand falls on her shoulder.
AH!
Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.
No, it's fine. My fault. How are you, Rosa?
Hungry. Let's go to lunch.
Um... right. We agreed to that yesterday.
Yep. Grab your purse. Let's see if Eve wants to come with us and get going. 
Eve, you hungry? Wanna go to lunch?
No, thank you. I have some work to finish. Enjoy.
Okay. See you in a bit.
The two head out, striding from the building and down the street as the midday traffic surges by.
Thanks for inviting me out today, Rosa.
It's my pleasure. I figure it's the least I can do for you. You kind of got thrown into the deep end at this job, and it's sink or swim here.
Well, I appreciate everything. So, where are we going?
There's a little coffee shop just down the street. Cute place, good food. You'll like it, and probably end up drinking gallons of their coffee if you stay on.
It's what keeps us going when we need to burn the midnight oil.
The shop is nice and quite chic, looking as if it was built fairly recently.
The pair enter, immediately greeted by a young woman, no older than eighteen or nineteen, standing behind the counter.
Rosa! How's it going?
Hi, Blake. I can't complain.
I see you're with a friend today.
This is Jessica. She's just starting up with us at the newspaper. 
Nice to meet you!
Likewise.
So, the usual?
Of course. I have to watch my figure, after all.
It's not like you need to. You look fantastic.
Rosa gave the girl a knowing smile and shook her head.
Give it twenty years and you'll understand, sweetie.
And for you, Jessica?
Uh, I'll have a beef sandwich and an iced tea, please.
Alright, find yourselves a table and I'll bring you the food right way.
They find an empty table for two and sit down.
For some time, the two exchange small talk, going into their education, where they were from, past experiences, all the while waiting for their order.
A few minutes later Blake arrives with their order.
Here you go. Beef sandwich and an iced tea for Jessica, and a garden salad and coffee for Rosa.
Thank you, Blake. So, how are things going at the college?
Quite good. I'm learning so much about running a business.
You're a business major?
Yeah. Hopefully, one day I'll be ready to take over this place.
Hah, I take it the manager wouldn't be entirely happy about your ambitions.
Quite the contrary, it's his plan, I'm just cooperating. As any good daughter should.
Oh, he's your father.
With acknowledging nod Blake smiles back at Jessica.
Then I'm sure he's happy with your efforts.
Well, there are some things I do at the campus he wouldn't be happy to seeâ€¦
Blake mimes drinking a beer before curling her hand and mimicking sucking a dick.
Rosa smiles, while Jessica gives a chuckle.
Ah, Blake, you are a treasure.
*giggle* Anyway, you two enjoy.
Jessica chuckles, shaking her head before hungrily taking a massive bite from her sandwich.
Wow, you're a hungry little lady. Reminds me of my oldest.
Jessica smiled, swallowing her mouthful before wiping her hand across her lips.
That's funny. My boyfriend said the same thing, but about his soldier buddies.
He was in the army?
*nods* Mmm-hmm. Served in Afghanistan.
Any children?
Not yet. How many do you have?
Two. A 9 year-old boy and a 4 year-old girl. Both are little hellions.
Jessica smiles, taking another bite of her sandwich.
You married?
Yes. To Hector, my heart of hearts.
Your family sounds lovely.
They are. As hard as it can be raising kids, it's worth every minute of it. Have you and your boyfriend... what's his name?
Conner.
Have you and Conner thought about kids.
Jessica's smile diminishes, thoughts of the idea of having kids with Conner flitting through her mind.
Not really. He's been deployed so often, and we've been apart so long that kids just weren't on the table. Not with how little we saw of each other.
Aside from having one parent raise the kids since he was gone so much, it would have meant he would have missed the birth of his children. So we just never talked about it.
And now that he's back?
Maybe. He hasn't been back long. I'm starting a new job, he's starting a new job. We've got to let things settle a bit before we even talk about it.
And the truth is... um. You know, I'm sorry.
Hmm?
I'm sorry. I was gonna get into something, but I don't know why I was going to bring it up.
It's alright. Anything you'd like to say, I'm more than willing to listen.
Well, we just... we've been separated for such long periods, that we just seem to have drifted apart somewhat. You know?
I feel like he doesn't... really open up to me anymore, and I guess I'm the same way.
Like we should have this down, but it feels like we're just starting to date again. Plus, he just feels... different. Like he's not the same man I met in high school.
And maybe I'm not the same girl either.
It's more of an annoyance to work through, though. I love him, he loves me. We'll work it out, and get back to the way things used to be.
I'm glad to hear that.
Anyway, tell me about Hector.
He owns a Salsa dance studio. It's barely profitable, but it makes him happy.
And when he's...
The sound of a phone ringing interrupts Rosa. Pulling it out, she takes a glimpse of the screen and answers.
She speaks briefly with someone, a large smile playing across her face.
Wonderful. With the documents I received earlier today, this should be more than enough. I'll visit him later today and see if he'll talk now.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Excellent! You're wonderful! I owe you one, sweetie! Later.
Hanging up, Rosa puts her phone on the table and smiles up at Jessica.
I've been working on a story involving an old bridge near Crosstown exchange that needs urgent repair.
A private consultant was hired to survey the bridge, and make a recommendation.
The consultant's report wasn't made public, but one of my sources said that it stated the bridge could be easily repaired.
City Hall ignored it, though, pushing to demolish the bridge and introduce a bill to construct a new one.
You think they're intentionally wasting money?
Indeed, millions of tax dollars going down the drain because they're unwilling to fix it for some reason. Repairs would cost a fraction of what a new bridge would.
I've already talked to the consultant. Some sexist ass. The only thing he told me was he was hired, he made his report, and turned it in.
I want that report. We already talked to another construction company, and they agreed the bridge can be repaired, easily and cheaply.
You're going to expose City Hall's waste? Reveal that the bridge can be fixed instead of wasting all that money?
That's right. Our own investigations into the bridge would be enough to write about, but if I have the original report stating that it can be repaired, that lends a lot of weight to the article.
If I confront the original consultant with my evidence, I might be able to get the report out of him. That's where I'm heading next.
You wanna come along? It'll be good for you to see how we do this sort of thing.
Absolutely. When did you want to go?
As soon as you're ready, we'll head back to the office. I need to print out a few papers.
Jessica quickly drained the last of her iced-tea and the two stopped by the counter to pay for their lunch.
They exchange a few words with Blake and set out, making their way back to the Gazette.
After dropping by the office to print out the documents Rosa needed and then catching a cab, the pair soon arrived at the consultant's office.
Man, the receptionist was not very fond of the guy.
Hmm?
Just her hostility when she pointed us towards his office.
Oh, that. I only talked to the guy on the phone, but I'm positive he's a major misogynist, so I'm not surprised he treats her like shit.
I'm sure the prospect of having two journalists roast this guy made her feel all giddy, though.
Just be careful. Guys like this can get really hostile, and occasionally pretty nasty.
We may have to scare him a little if we want him to cooperate. A firm approach is the only safe bet with this type of men.
Gotcha.
Arriving at the man's office, Rosa knocked on his door. A moment later it opened to reveal the man, a huge grin crossing his face when he realizes that two gorgeous women had come to speak to him.
Ladies. A pleasure to meet you. Please, come in.
Thank you.
Allow me to introduce myself. My name's Angus Halliday. How can I help you beauties?
My name is Rosa Jimenez, and this is my colleague Jessica O'Neil. We're from the New Port Gazette.
The man's smile quickly disappeared from his face as he slumps back into his chair.
Oh, fuck me. You're that reporter on the phone.
Look, I already told you - I did my job, made my report. I got nothin' else to say to you.
Well, I was hoping you'd change your mind.
Rosa opens her handbag, withdrawing the papers she'd printed earlier and places them on the man's desk.
He is clearly unhappy, but begins looking at the papers as Rosa continues.
My journal commissioned another report on the bridge, as you can see. Do you agree with their conclusion about the state of the bridge?
The man sneered, sliding the papers back at Rosa before leaning back and turning his head dismissively to the side.
It took him just a minute to check it out, probably because he knew what he would find there.
I don't make a habit of evaluating or commenting on my colleagues' work.
A smile begins to creep over the man's face then, until it had becomes a gigantic grin.
His eyes then turn hungrily to Jessica, working up and down her body but particularly focusing on her breasts.
Why don't you two lovely ladies let me take you out to dinner?
We could see the city, have a little fun. *shrug* And who knows, I might be more willing to talk after a bottle of wine.
The ladies exchange glances, both shaking their heads slightly and rolling their eyes before returning their gaze to the pig sitting in front of them.
Or, and I'm just spitballing here, my friend goes ahead and writes up her story, while I ask around this building to see if anyone has any fun sexual harassment tales to tell.
Somehow, I have a feeling I'll find more than a few.
Again, the man's smile fades away, replaced by a scowl. For the first time, he was staring into Jessica's eyes instead of her tits.
And wouldn't those just make the best little fluff stories.
Flustered, the man turns away from her gaze, staring at his desk.
Jessica turns her eyes to her companion for a moment, only briefly unsure of how to proceed.
Striding around to the other side of the desk, she takes a seat on the edge, smiling down at the grinning man.
You know, my friend here has put in a lot of work to find out what happened. Isn't there any way you could help her out?
After all, I'm sure she'd appreciate it. And maybe she could be your friend too.
Jessica...
It's okay. I wouldn't mind making friends with such a handsome man. After all, fun is so much better between friends.
The man chuckles, placing his hand on Jessica's leg, continuing to undress her with his eyes.
Jessica smiles, her hand moving up her body, resting suggestively just above her breast.
And we'd be very grateful friends if we could get that report.
Listen...
At this point, I know what my story's going to say. The only question here, Mr. Halliday, is what to say about you?
What are you talking about?
Well, who are you? Are you the expert whose competent opinion was ignored by the administration in this shady scheme?
I suspect that's the case, and that's what I'd like to write.
Or am I going to just leave the question hanging? Perhaps your faulty report misled City Hall, and you're going to be the one who costs this city millions of dollars.
Hey, I did my fucking job! I was hired to do a consultation, I did it and turned in my report. Whatever they decided is on them, not me. If they ignored my advice, that's not my fault.
I'm sure we can prove that. Once my story comes out, I'm sure City Hall would gladly make your report public, and we'll gladly print it...
...on page 14, right under the latest Hollywood gossip...
I'm sure that'll prove your innocence, to whatever bored housewife reads past the latest Kardashian news... if they bother reading that far.
We can also have several other experts pick it apart to check its actual competence...
The man's face becomes a picture of rage, his hands gripping the armrests of his chair as he sucks in a breath to retort. Rosa beats him to the punch, holding up her hands.
Or... you can just give me the report. I don't need a statement from you, and no one needs to know where I got this. As far as anyone is concerned, this came from a source in City Hall.
His anger seems to bleed away, giving him an appearance that shocks Jessica as she watches his demeanor shift. Suddenly, she could see something in him she hadn't expected at all - fear.
Alright, look. What the report you commissioned says is pretty much what I said in my report to the city. The bridge can be easily and cheaply fixed.
...Give me an email address and I'll send you a copy.
A couple of minutes later Rosa receives the email on her phone and starts reading the document.
The city administration wanted someone to validate their own plan, and when my report didn't say what they wanted, they told me to shut up and talk to no one about it.
Please, do not tell anyone where you got this. I'm screwed if this gets out.
I promise. I've never met you before.
Rosa extends her hand, Angus reluctantly returning her handshake.
I appreciate your cooperation in this matter. You've been incredibly helpful.
Angus shakes his head, rolling his eyes.
Whatever. Just go.
Come on, Jessica.
The man slumps back into his chair once more as the pair exits his office, heading toward the elevator.
Not bad, Jessica.
Really?
Oh yeah. You're natural. I think you're gonna do well here.
Thanks. It makes me happy to hear you say that.
We need good reporters at the Gazette, and I think you'll do just fine.
Uh-huh.
Angus' gaze returns to Jessica, a smile lighting up his face.
Hey, that dinner offer's still on the table, sweetie. What do you think? You, me, a night out. I'll promise it'll be a date you'll never forget.
A seductive smile crosses Jessica's face, but before she could disappoint the man with a story about Conner, Rosa does it for her.
We should get going, Jessica. Don't you have to head home to meet your soldier boyfriend?
I do, and he tends to get angry when I'm held up by other men.
The man's smile fades, but he shrugs and sits back in his chair.
The offer's still open.
The pair exits the office, making their way toward the elevator.
Damnit, Jessica.
What?
You shouldn't play games with pigs like that. Act like a piece of meat, and you'll get treated like one.
Sorry... It would have worked, though.
That's beside the point. Just... be more careful in the future. Alright?
I will.
Alright. We have what we need. Let's get this back and get it written up.
Back in the office Jessica finally manages to finish the work Duncan gave her and is ready to go home.
I hope Mr. Parker is right and this is the only lame task Duncan would ask of me.
Hey, Rosa. You still working?
Yeah. I've gotta get this story written up so I can get it edited and delivered to the printer.
Alright. I'm heading out for the day. Hey, I wanted to say thanks for today. I'm glad I had the chance to see you work.
Rosa looks up from her computer for a moment, giving Jessica a warm smile.
I'm glad you came, too. We're a good team.
Thanks. You have a good night.
You too.
Pleased to no end with how the day had gone, Jessica leaves the building smiling, eager to meet up with Conner and end the day with a bang.
Rosa keeps typing, looking at her computer as she speaks.
Mmm-hmm. It was nice to have a sidekick. You have a good night.
Yeah. You too.
Pleased with how the day had gone, Jessica leaves the building smiling, eager to meet up with Conner and end the day with a bang.
Back at home, Jessica sheds her work clothes, eager to get into something more comfortable for a little while.
She takes the time to look herself over, staring at her body in the mirror.
She spends quite a lot of time ensuring she always looks good, as she takes great pride in her appearance, but Heather's comments from earlier had really made her feel sexy as hell.
As she turns this way and that, she comes to admire her curves in a way she never had.
It felt wonderful to have another woman so earnestly praising her, and it made her feel sexy in a way she hadn't since before Conner had come home.
Hopefully, he'd see her that way tonight. She feels good, and she wants him to see her as sexy as she feels.
After taking a quick shower, she sets about taking care of a few household chores: checking her email, doing laundry, readying dinner.
Standing in front of the fridge while selecting supper felt nice, the cool air a welcome change from the hot and sweaty day she'd had running around.
A short while later, she stands at the kitchen counter readying a simple spaghetti meal when she hears the front door open.
Hey, babe. I'm back.
Hey, sweetie. Welcome home.
Conner approaches from behind, pulling Jessica into a hug before kissing her neck.
I missed you all day long.
I missed me all day too.
Hehehe. You're not as funny as you think.
Made you laugh.
That you did. How was your day?
Kind of amazing, actually.
Oh yeah?
Yeah. I may have helped exposed corruption in City Hall.
Damn, sweetie! Day two and already you're a moral crusader. A freaking superhero!
Well, it was mostly the woman I was working with. I was pretty much along for the ride, but I definitely helped.
Well, it was mostly the woman I was working with. I was pretty much along for the ride...
Rosa was not thrilled with that flirt, but I'm sure it would've worked.
And the guy would've been much friendlier if we ever need him in the future.
Let me get rid of this shirt real quick and then you can tell me everything.
Okay, sweetie.
Conner comes back a few minutes later, helping to set the table before the pair sit down to eat.
Jessica then sets about regaling her love with the tale of corruption, buried secrets and a dogged reporter eager to track down the truth.
This Rosa sounds like one hell of a woman.
Oh, she's ferocious. Not quite like any other woman I've ever met, and an amazing reporter.
That's exactly the kind of reporter I want to be.
Digging through the lies, finding the truth and writing it for all the world to see, and all the while giving a giant middle finger to anyone who tells me I can't do it!
You know, if I'm ever allowed to do so and not just transcribing.
Sweetie, you've been on the job two days and already you've helped uncover City Hall's dirty dealings. You're not gonna be doing shit work for long, I know it.
Thanks, baby. I love you so much.
I love you too.
Alright. Would you do dishes for me? I'm gonna go get ready.
Sure thing. I'd say take your time, but... please don't. Let's get going at a decent hour this time.
I'm positive I have no idea what you're talking about. I'll only take a few hours, that's all.
With a smile, Jessica disappeared into their bathroom leaving Conner to clean up the kitchen.
It takes Conner less than 20 minutes to finish with both the kitchen and changing his clothes, ready to head out.
Taking a seat on the couch, he passes the time watching TV, waiting for Jessica to finish making herself up.
A little while later, the bedroom door opens, revealing a stunning Jessica, looking absolutely dressed to kill.
Well? What do you think? Like the look?
Sweetie, you could be dressed in anything, and I'd think you were the sexiest creature on this Earth.
*sigh* He can't just give me one compliment? Oh well. I don't want to ruin the evening.
Well, geez, you could have said that before I spent half an hour on this hair.
Conner laughs while rising and offering his hand to the gorgeous lady.
I'll make it up to you tonight. Come on. What's say we go have some fun?
Yes, please.
Hand in hand, they leave the apartment, Jessica ready to reconnect to the man she loves so very much.
The pair can hear the heavy bass of the music before they even reach the door of the nightclub - The Brass Pole.
Stepping inside, they soon find themselves assaulted by the sounds, barely able to hear one another talk as they look around.
It's still early, and as such the crowds hadn't arrived just yet, giving them their choice of tables.
I think we should claim a table!
What?!
I said, we should get a table! Up on the second floor!
Good idea!
Jessica is well aware that Conner is not the biggest fan of yelling back and forth while surrounded by loud noises. Bad memories.
So she appreciates that he was taking her to such a place, and has already forgiven him in her head.
Of course, she still intends to dance while they are here, and hopefully by the end of the night she'd be in the mood to head home and get pounded as hard as her soldier boy could manage.
The second floor is a little less noisy and they quickly find a small table for two.
Be back in a second.
In a few minutes he is back with a beer and a martini.
I like the firestation theme here!
It's pretty cool, isn't it?!
I was tempted to slide down that pole when I went down for drinks instead of using the stairs!
You went downstairs for drinks?!
Yeah! Of course!
You know they have another bar up here, right?!
Conner follows her finger, finally spotting the upstairs bar he'd missed earlier, just behind him.
Yeah! I knew about it! So what?!
Jessica laughs, shaking her head and planting a kiss on the man's cheek.
I'm tempted to use that pole, too! Maybe later, after a few more drinks!
Oh yeah?!
It won't be to get drinks, though!
Ha! Ah, you're just teasing me!
Jessica bobs her head from side to side.
Yes! I am teasing!
A few minutes pass, the pair chatting back and forth, the music soon switching to another song.
Oh my god! I love this song! Come on! I want to go dance!
Oh! Okay! I guess we'll just leave these incredibly expensive drinks just sitting here!
Be cheap later! Come on!
Jessica practically pulls Conner onto the dance floor, dragging him downstairs by his hand until they find themselves surrounded by the other dancers.
They immediately begin moving to the rhythm. Jessica loves dancing, and her body moves in elegant patterns, her stance clearly relaxed and comfortable.
Conner's stiffer and less practiced, but he goes with the flow, moving along with Jessica and allowing his body to match her movements.
They dance for the duration of the song, both of them warming up with the constant rhythm.
Once the song ends, the pair steps off the floor, their breath heavy.
That was fun! I forgot how much I enjoy dancing with you!
Me too! We need to do this more often!
We should get back to our drinks! Seriously, that martini was twenty bucks!
Haha! Okay! I'm gonna use the ladies room and be right up.
Conner plants a kiss on Jessica's cheek before she heads off.
After using the restroom, she made her way back toward the stairs, noticing that the crowds had begun to grow since they'd entered.
As she nears the stairs, she realizes that a man is directly behind her, likewise heading up.
Damnit. He's going up the stairs too. I go up, he's gonna have the perfect view of my ass, along with my other bits.
I'll justâ€¦ let him pass.
Jessica steps aside, allowing the man to pass by before she heads up herself.
The only man who's going to have a look up my dress tonight is Conner, dude.
Finally reaching the top, Jessica walks off to the side, joining her boyfriend once again.
Fuck it. It's not that big a deal. Besides, I'm wearing panties. And maybe I can cover up a bit.
Jessica heads up, doing her best to pull her dress down over her ass as she goes.
Damnit. I had to wear this dress tonight, didn't I? It's so short I'm surprised it can cover my ass at all, and there's no way I can pull it down any further.
Yeah, he must be enjoying the show. That's weird, though. Why do I feel a little tingle in my stomach?
Why does a man staring up my dress makes me feel that way?
Finally reaching the top, Jessica joins Conner at their table.
What a strange sensation that was.
Conner had grabbed both of them another drink, and the two sit chatting for a bit about nothing much at all.
Conner goes over his duties at the center, fairly basic and simple stuff, but Jessica listens attentively nonetheless. It feels nice to be such a close part of his world once again.
You really do look beautiful tonight, baby.
Well thank you, sweetie. Where did that come from?
I just wanted to say it. You're the hottest woman in this whole place.
Jessica smiles, standing up and moving over to Conner, where she plants herself down on his lap.
And you're the sweetest, best looking guy here. Or that I've ever met in my life.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah.
The two share a kiss - long, soft, and romantic.
Thanks for taking me out tonight. This means a lot.
My pleasure, babe. You deserve it, after all you've put up with me over the years.
Jessica heaves a long sigh, savoring the feel of his hand on her back, his breath on her mouth, and the sound of the slow song that had just begun to play.
Come on. Let's go dance again.
Um, just aâ€¦ ahem. Just a minute. I'll need a minute before I can stand.
Hehehe. Alright. I'll be downstairs. Don't keep me waiting, handsome.
As Jessica walks off, hips swaying back and forth, she hears Conner sigh, knowing full well his eyes are glued to her ass.
A few minutes later, Conner finds her standing by the dance floor, a huge grin on her face.
Taking his hand, Jessica leads him out once again, the man's hands grasping her waist as they begin to sway with the music.
After a few moments, she turns around in his arms, throwing her own around his shoulders before planting a kiss on his lips.
This has been a great night, baby.
It has. I love you so much.
I love you too.
...
Babe, I want you. I want you so bad.
You wanna get out of here?
Yeah, but I don't want to go home. I can't wait that long.
Alley?
Alley.
The two exit through a side door and find themselves in a small back alley.
The full moon filling the space with its light, not quite giving them the privacy they need. Both of them too horny to care.
Conner pushes Jessica gently against the wall of the building, pressing himself into her body as their lips lock together in a passionate embrace.
No thoughts of the alley's filth give Jessica pause, instead driving her wild with unrestrained passion.
This place is so dirty, so exposed. God, it's making me hot!
His hands grasp at her skirt, pulling it up before his left hand slips beneath her pantyhose and into her panties.
Oh god, that feels good! Just like that, Conner.
Yeah, that feels nice. You're already so wet.
Keep going! Oh god, your fingers are fucking magical!
Conner keeps it up for a minute or so, his fingers working Jessica's soaking cunt as she continues to moan in ecstasy.
I need you, baby. I need to be inside you.
Oh, yes! Get that dick out and fuck me!
Conner rips Jessica's pantyhose, pulling aside her panties, and starting to tease her warm slit with his rigid cock.
Jessica moans in anticipation, eager to receive his hard member.
Ooh, put it in. Please!
Conner spreads her legs wide and shoves his member past her soaking, glistening folds.
Jessica's body tenses immediately as he presses her hips against the wall, her fingers digging into his back.
Oh god! Oh god, I can feel you deep inside me! Your cock feels amazing!
How's this? UNGH!
OH! Yes! Fuck me, just like that!
Conner leans in to Jessica, kissing her neck as he begins to thrust inside of her.
As his lips devoure her flesh, her head lolls to the side, her eyes opening ever so slightly as her lips part in a gasp of bliss.
From the corner of her eyes she notices movement by a nearby dumpster.
Opening her eyes further, she realizes an old man in ratty clothes is watching them from the shadows.
Strangely, Jessica feels no reason to stop, even with the audience they now have. Quite the opposite. She begins shoving herself into Conner while pulling him in even tighter.
What the fuck? That guy's watching us. That'sâ€¦ that'sâ€¦
Fucking hot!
Conner, don't stop, but there's someone watching.
What?
Conner begins to turn to look, but Jessica pulls his face back toward her.
No no no. Look at me. Focus on me. Fuck me, baby. Fuck me hard.
Wow. *shakes head* You're kinkier than I knew, baby.
Hehehe. Oh yeah. Fuck your kinky slut, baby. Fuck her! Hard!
Alright. Uh. If you insist, butâ€¦
Whoa.
Conner reverses position, leaning against the wall while holding Jessica up with just his hands. His gaze soon finds the hobo, who shrinks back into the shadows but continues to watch.
Just to be safe. In case he tries anything.
Stop talking and fuck me, please!
Gladly. HUNGH!
AGH!
Jessica finds the attention exhilarating and exciting, enhancing what is already a really good dicking. She can feel Conner's body tense up, though, apparently unsure of the situation.
Baby, this is so fucking hot. It feels amazing having someone watching while we fuck.
Conner says nothing, simply continuing to fuck her while focusing on the pleasure building in his cock.
He feels weird, but the sensation of his girlfriend's soaking cunt tightly gripping his dick is more than enough to keep him going.
In addition, he is loving the sight of her tits bouncing within her dress.
Keep going, baby. I'm almost there.
God, you're so hot.
Oh, Conner. I'm gonna cum, baby. I'm gonna cum.
Me too.
Oh god, here it comes! NNGH!
Yes! NNGH! AH!
The pair hang onto one another tightly, their simultaneous orgasms driving each to the height of ecstasy.
Conner feels Jessica's juices flowing down from her womanhood as she feels his warm cum splashing inside her cunt.
Oh my god. Oh my god.
Whew. Damn, baby. That was intense.
Yeah. Yeah it was.
We, uh, we should get out of here.
Yeah. Let's go home.
Jessica heaves a sigh as she changes, discarding her dirty and torn clothing as she readies herself for bed.
Despite her exhaustion, and being a little sore, she couldn't remember the last time she'd had so much fun going out.
Oh wow. I haven't been this tired in a while.
Feels good, right? Climbing into bed after exhausting yourself. Happens a lot when you're deployed.
Yeah. It's been a long day, and it ended wonderfully.
The pair curl up next to one another in bed, each planting a kiss on one another's lips.
Yeah. I wouldn't have thought I would have enjoyed that.
It wasâ€¦ interesting.
I know, right? I can't believe we did that. It was so energizing. I still haven't shaken off all the adrenaline.
We probably shouldn't do it again, though. It wasn't a very safe thing to do. And also a little creepy.
I guess. Still, it was a lot of fun. I'm glad I got to have such a good time with you tonight.
Me too. Good night, baby.
Goodnight.
The pair settle down for the night, Conner drifting away exhausted. Jessica finding it more difficult to find sleep, her thoughts remaining back in the alley.
God that was hot. I'm really, really glad we went out tonight. Feeling Conner inside me while that man watched was justâ€¦ incredible.
I'm not sure Conner would go for doing it again, but maybe I can convince him, cause I REALLY want to do it again.
I'll think about it. Maybe there's a way to go about it without scaring my baby off.
A smile drifted onto her lips as she sighed in contentment.
Maybe I should find someone we already know.
Huh?
Uh, nothing. Keep going, baby.
Jessica locks eyes with the man watching as her boyfriend continues to thrust inside her, feeling her arousal rising with each and every thrust.
I can't believe I'm doing this. Letting a man watch me fuck my boyfriendâ€¦ and not even saying anything to Conner.
Butâ€¦ it's so goddamn hot!
As the man watches the couple continue to fuck, Conner slamming his dick inside Jessica again and again, his hand goes down to his own pants, pulling out his already rigid cock.
Oh my god. He's actually gonna do it. He's gonna jerk off while watching us.
I can barely see it, but it's not very big, and definitely dirty. This is wrong. So dirty, so very dirty.
Feelings of guilt mix with sensations of ecstasy as Jessica stares at the hobo's dick, her eyes watching the man's hand slide back and forth along the organ while her boyfriend's thick manhood fills her pussy.
Her gaze remains fixed as Conner slowly slides inside her over and over again, the gorgeous blonde almost reveling in the idea of another sharing their coital bliss.
What would Conner do if he knew? I don't want him to know. He'd put a stop to this and itâ€¦ feels too good.
Just keep going, Conner. Fill me up, baby.
For a brief moment, Jessica considers that she should tell her boyfriend. Be honest with him.
When she turns her face to his, though, their lips meet, and all thought of honesty vanishes. She feels too good to spoil her pleasure.
Jessica closes her eyes, pulling Conner closer as she feels her orgasm coming closer and closer.
The thoughts of being watched by such a disgusting, unwashed hobo is driving her wild, and bringing her ever closer to the edge.
God, I hope the guy cums. I want to see his cum.
The man is rapidly stroking his penis, just as Conner is rapidly thrusting inside Jessica.
The bum's bearded mouth opens in pleasure as he nears his orgasm, ready to cum for the lady willing to let him watch.
I'm almost there. Oh god, I'm gonna cum! Oh, my god, we're all gonna cum!
Cum with me! Please, cum with me!
I will, baby! I'm gonna cum! Let's cum together!
Jessica's eyes open, staring at the filthy man in the shadows.
Yes! Let's cum together!
A moment later, the hobo begins to cum, thin streams of white cum sliding out of his cock as he watches the young couple fuck.
Conner grunts and closes his eyes tight as his cock begins to twitch within Jessica, his cum splashing against her cervix.
As she feels her boyfriend filling her with his warm semen, and she watches the stranger's penis spurting and jumping in his hand, Jessica's own sex begins to convulse, disgorging its juices onto Conner as a perverse sense of lusty arousal fills her entire body.
After a moment of heavy breathing, Conner kisses Jessica, her hands pulling his face into her embrace as the stranger slips back into the shadows and away from the couple.
Baby, that wasâ€¦ wow.
Yeah. That wasâ€¦ something else.
Alright. Why don't we go ahead and head home?
Definitely. I need a shower.
I feel so damn dirty.
Jessica heaves a sigh as she changes, discarding her dirty and torn clothing as she readies herself for bed.
Despite her exhaustion, and being a little sore, she couldn't remember the last time she'd had so much fun going out.
Climbing into bed, she finds her boyfriend fast asleep, exhausted by the evening's events.
Poor Conner. I drained him completely. In more ways than one.
But damn, if that wasn't the hottest sex we've had in a while.
Is it weird that after sex with my boyfriend, all I can think about is the sight of that guy cumming?
Good night, baby. Mwa!
Jessica settles in for the night, her mind still back in the alley.
I'm really, really glad we went out tonight. Feeling Conner inside me while I looked into that man's eyes was justâ€¦ incredible.
I feel a little bad for not telling Conner, it's like I've lied to him.
But the danger of my boyfriend finding out about the other guy was so thrilling.
And that hobo was willing to risk a beating, just so he could wank on watching me fuck.
I felt so in control of both men, so empowered.
