Baby!! What was that for!?
It's the panties babe, I had to have a feel.
A spank isn't a feel! I don't mind feels..
Is that so? I don't mind them either.
Nope! Not after the spank!
Oooh. I'll keep that in mind.
Maybe you need a spanking...
I probably deserve one. But I think what we all deserve is getting some rest.
Aah, fair enough. Me and Shauna will surprise spank you some other time.
I'm sure you will, but just not tonight.
How do you two want to sleep?
With my two girls on top of me. Is that okay?
Yes.. I would like that.
You first [g1].
Comfy?
Mhmm. I'm perfect.
All right, Shauna climb right on.
Is that okay? Are you comfortable?
Just like [g1]. I'm perfect right now. I love you girls. Goodnight, I hope you both sleep well.
I love you too. Goodnight, sleep well.
I love you too [mcf]. Goodnight..
Today was a good ass day. I'm ready to tackle whatever tomorrow brings. Hopefully I don't have anymore dreams...
Not like I could go anywhere with these two on top of me anyway..
Zzzz...
Many hours later
Hmmmm... Where am I?
Oh yeah, on a couch with my girls. This is much better than waking up in someone's basement.
Might have been nicer if I woke up in an actual bed, but I'll take it.
I wonder what time it is... I never did set an alarm. I can't really get up to check without waking them up.
*Clears throat* Ahem..
[mcf]?
Shauna? Are you awake?
Maybe, what's up?
What are you doing up? Could you not sleep?
I went to sleep just fine. I had a dream about going to the arcade though... It woke me up and I've been too excited to fall back asleep.
That, and I had a lot to think about.
I'm sure you did. I think we need to talk. I know you, there's a lot of emotions you're not comfortable showing in front of [g1] yet.
So while she's asleep we should talk about everything.
Yeah? Can you get up if I do?
Should be able to, I'll just have to slide out from under [g1].
Or I could just lay here and enjoy the view.
Hehe, come on. I really want to talk.
Just have to get out from under [g1]. I can't believe this girl.
Everything me and her did yesterday, from the sex in the bathroom to telling me I can be with other girls.
Hell, it wasn't even just telling me I could be. She basically tried to throw me at Natalie.
I just hope this is what she really wants and its not her being afraid of losing me. I feel like I could tell if she wasn't being genuine though.
The question now is what do I want?
I've cheated on her... The girl who has given me everything I want.
She said she doesn't want to know if I did cheat. I don't know if that's something I can keep a secret forever.
What would the point be in telling her though? To make me feel better and to hurt her feelings? She doesn't deserve that.
I'm going to need help figuring out how to handle this. Only one I can go to with this is [am]. I hope she understands.
I haven't been with anyone else and it would have been easy for me to. Do I really want to be with others?
I love Shauna and I'll call her my girl until the day I die... but do I want to be with her in that way?
All I can do now is just go with it. I need to let Shauna know my intentions though.
The very last thing I want is for either of them to get hurt.
It hurts me to even leave her like this. I just want to hold her and make all her worries go away.
Me and her have never even had an argument, outside of her thinking I was cheating on her sister. She's been nothing but perfect.
Sure, she didn't want to have sex at first. But that made that moment yesterday special. I've never felt as close to her as I did then.
That makes me feel like me and Shauna could have missed a special moment like that.
We were both excited and rushed into sex. It was great and we've been building to that moment since we were young but part of it felt wrong.
I think that's because we didn't give our actual relationship time to grow first.
Maybe me and her should reset. Take this opportunity to do that and go slowly this time. Ease into everything.
I hope me and her continue to grow closer together. I hope introducing other girls into our relationship doesn't pull us apart a bit.
I just need to continue to make sure she feels loved and cared for. After I make it in the league I'll be able to show her just how much she means to me.
Are you okay [mcf]?
Yeah, I was just thinking about how much I love you two girls and how lucky I am to be here right now.
Awwwh. You mean that?
Of course I do. I know you don't always feel like it but you're fucking beautiful Shauna. So is [g1]. The fact that you're both mine is insane.
Can we stay in this room? I don't want her to wake up and us not be in here.
Thank you [mcf].. I never know how to reply to your compliments.
And yes we can. Let's just prop up against the wall.
Sounds good with me.
So do you want to start or should I? I have a lot to say.
Then you should go first. You already know what I'm going to say but..
Let it all off my chest?
Exactly. It's gotten us to this point hasn't it?
Hah, true. We wouldn't be here if you didn't make me tell you about how I felt.
So I'm just going to start by asking... Am I your girlfriend?
Of course Shauna, you're my girlfriend. What's got you asking that?
I spent all night overthinking everything. I just needed to hear it out loud again.
You're my girl Shauna. You're more than that though, you're my bestfriend. I don't want these new emotions to take over the old ones.
I want to be able to take you on dates and I want you to get all dressed up and be cute for me.
But I also want to be able to just cuddle up and watch a show together. I want that fun loving goofy girl that was all about bets and pranks.
I want us to play games and just be the bestfriends we have always been. But add all these new feelings onto it.
Does that clear things up a bit?
[mcf]... That's exactly what I want. I've never been in a relationship before, I don't know if I'll be good at it. I know I can be a good bestfriend.
I know you can be too. You've been the fucking best. There isn't a thing I would change about you.
I wouldn't change anything about you either [mcf]. I've told you a million times but I'll say it again. You're the reason I am the girl I am today.
Everything? Are you sure about that?
Are you talking about what I think you're talking about?
Yeah...
You should know that I don't care about that. I love you the same as I would if you didn't have it.
You're not just saying that?
You know I wouldn't do that.
What if people call you names for being with a girl like me?
Don't talk about yourself like that Shauna. You're a girl and I don't care what anyone has to say.
I get to come home and be with you two girls. They can say whatever they want to say but I'm living in my own personal heaven.
I love you [mcf]... I was just the kid that got picked on before you came into my life, everyone's punching bag.
Not only did you stand up for me way back then, you let me be your friend. You didn't have to.
You were the star back then too. You could have had anyone as a friend. While I'm so fucking grateful, I'll never understand why.
I thought about that a lot back then. Like what if you were just being nice to me as a prank?
There were girls throwing themselves at you, asking you out on dates and what not. Yet you would always spend time with me instead.
You're the only person in my life that has never made me feel inadequate. You've always been there to pick me up when I fall down.
I fucking love you [mcf], badly. I have for years.
Shauna, I love you too. But you make it sound like I was doing charity work. I loved being around you. You were always there for me and you knew how to make me laugh.
Those other girls were vapid. You had personality and charm. I was doing what I wanted to do.
Yeah? I'm just happy you saw that in me, I didn't back then.
There's another thing I need to talk about and I'm scared it might dissapoint you.
What is it?
I know we've fooled around behind [g1]. I regret it now.
I do too.
We also rushed into everything. While what we did was amazing. I mean that, it was fucking amazing.
What if we started over? Did things right this time. I didn't know before last night that I wanted all the dates and bonding time and all that.
But I do. I want to build our relationship up on emotion and not on sex. You didn't do anything wrong. I probably wanted it more than you did.
I'm sorry [mcf] but I think we shouldn't do those things again until after we grow this relationship.
Haha... That's strange.
What? I'm sorry.
No, no. Don't be sorry. It's just funny because when I was getting out from under [g1] a second ago I had the exact same thought.
We jumped straight into it and while it was amazing, I think we should start over too.
I know I teased you about [g1] and how she made you two wait.
But I think I want that too. I'm sorry.
Yeah? That's perfectly fine Shauna. I was completely fine waiting until [g1] was ready. I have no problems doing the same for you.
We've been bestfriends forever but this is different. We have a chance to really build something special.
This can be whatever we want it to be. We can take it as slowly as you want to.
[mcf]... I love you so much. This is everything I've ever wanted. I don't know how to put it into words.
I just want to be the second best girlfriend in the world.
Second best?
I don't think I can beat [g1]. She's something special.
You're something special too Shauna but yeah. [g1] is amazing.
I never thought she'd be okay with something like this.
Me neither, like at all. Do you think she really wants this?
I can read [g1] pretty well. I think this is genuinely what she wants.
She brought it up on her own. I've never mentioned other girls to her.
She also kind of tried to throw me at Natalie yesterday.
Haha, what do you mean by that?
Telling me to grab her thigh, just things like that. Trying to get me to win her over.
Damn [g1]. Yeah, I'll settle for second best girlfriend. I'm not catching up to her.
Hah, it was different. Even though she was encouraging it... I still felt guilty.
It will probably come with time. It's still new.
What about you though? Are you cool with me being with other girls?
Honestly? At first I didn't know how to feel about it. After [g1] explained her mindset on it. I'm okay with it.
I can't say I'm super excited about it. I know the impact you're going to have in these girls lives and that's more important than if I get a little jealous.
I told [g1] this last night but it goes for you as well. If you're ever uncomfortable with something I'm doing. Just tell me.
I will, I promise. I don't think I'll ever not be jealous.
It's not a bad jealousy like I wish you weren't doing it. It's more of a 'I wish you were doing it with me'.
That's completely reasonable. I know it's completely hypocritical but I don't think I'd ever want to see you with someone else.
There's other people? I could've sworn it was just you.
Ha, I know how I sound. I just don't ever want to see you with someone else.
I wasn't joking. You're the only one I've ever had feelings for. You never have to worry about me. I'm yours [mcf].
Fuck... I want to kiss you again.
You know there's nothing stopping you right?
[g1] isn't awake...
She doesn't have to be? We're our own couple.
I know. Part of me is just worried that she'll wake up and feel differently about everything.
So I don't want to do anything until she's awake and says it's okay.
Okay, that's fair. I truly don't think anything will be different but if you want to wait then that's fine.
Hey, uhh. Do you know what time it is? I'm meant to go on a jog with Harper this morning.
Don't worry. It's early. It's probably a little past 5am.
Yeah? Good. I still have time to take a shower then. I'll be right back Shauna.
Take your time. I promise I won't peek this time.
Hah, I wasn't going to bring it up.
It was embarrassing but we wouldn't be here right now if I didn't do it. So I'm happy it happened.
Me too Shauna, I'll be back.
Oh, Stacy is still awake. I guess she didn't sleep last night.
Part of me wants to mess with her since she doesn't know I'm here but... I don't want to scare her away.
Good morning Stacy.
Oh, good morning [mcf]. Why are you up so early?
I'm going on a jog with my coach.
Oh, right. I should've known. With you being an athlete and all.
Have you slept at all?
Here and there. I've slept enough, thank you for letting me stay here.
You didn't have anymore dreams last night did you?
I don't think so. I don't remember any at least.
Good. Hopefully they're gone for good.
Yeah, hopefully. Are you still good with going to practice with me this morning?
Of course. Basketball isn't really my thing but I told you I'd help so I'll be there.
Thanks Stacy. Do you want me to ask the other girls to go? That way you'll at least have someone to spend time with.
Do you think they would mind?
I'm sure they'd be okay with it.
I'm going to hop in the shower now. Just be ready to go whenever I get back from my jog okay?
You got it, have a fun shower.
Ugh, my back kind of hurts. Why the fuck did we sleep on a couch?
No one even questioned it. We were all probably just out of our comfort zone and willing to go with whatever.
Anyway, I hope practice goes better today. I need to try and find out what is up with Damien.
Actually there's like 20 things I need to do today. It's going to be a fun one.
One morning routine later
You look nice this morning. The shower helped.
Ha, Thanks Stacy.
You're looking good too. You changed your makeup?
Wow, I'm surprised you noticed. I was just messing around with it since I got a bit bored last night.
It looks good. You should keep it like that.
Yeah? I like it too. Thanks [mcf].
Mhmm. I'm going to go say bye to the girls then head out. So you should get ready soon. Sorry for hammering that home, I just don't want to be late.
I understand. I'll be ready.
Thanks Stacy.
Now just to tell at least Shauna bye.
Who knows... maybe [g1] is awake. I hope she is. It's weird to say since she hasn't gone anywhere but I miss her right now.
Nope, she's still asleep. Why is Shauna sitting like that?
Shauna? What's wrong?
Shauna??
Hey, it's okay. I'm here. What happened?
It's just...
Gotcha!!
Oh you asshole... Haha, that's fucked up.
You said you wanted me to stay the same girl that loves bets and pranks.
Yeah, yeah I did. Fuck me, I actually thought something was wrong.
Sorry... That one was probably too far.
Just a little bit. It's okay though. I'll get you back.
Fuck... I'm sure you will. Haha
What are you two up to?
Oh babe, I didn't mean to wake you. I'm sorry.
It's okay, I want to be up.
How did you sleep?
Peacefully. Way more so than the night before.
Good, you're so cute when you're sleepy.
Well give this sleepy girl a good morning kiss.
Mwah!
Just what I needed. So what were you two up to?
Just talking about things. Expectations and what our relationship will be like.
Can I know about it?
Yeah, we basically just decided to handle it similarly to how me and you did. Take everything slowly.
We want our relationship to be as strong as our friendship.
It worked for us.
Damn right it did. Also Shauna had some concerns.
Like what?
She was afraid that you would wake up and change your mind about everything.
Awh...
She was too afraid to kiss me because she wanted to make sure it was still okay.
Shauna. Come sit on this couch please. You too [mcf].
Okay...
So Shauna, what is he to you?
What do you mean?
If someone asked you what you and [mcf] were. What would you tell them?
He's my boyfriend?
Mmhmm. Exactly. You don't need my permission to kiss your boyfriend.
I just... wanted to make sure.
I know Shauna. This is me telling you I'm sure. This is what I want.
I think it's awesome you two want to build up your relationship but if you think it's necessary because of me. It's not.
Me and [mcf] have our thing and you two have your thing. Whatever you two want it to be.
Now that you know what I want, what do you want?
I want to kiss him.
Mwah!
Don't let her off easy [mcf]. She needs to know this is what we want.
Do the tongue thing you did to me yesterday.
Mmmmm... Oh yeah, that'll do.
He's great at that isn't he? Makes your heart fluttery and knees a little weak?
Yeah, everything you said...
Now don't be afraid to do that whenever you want to Shauna. Whatever makes you happy.
I love you and you deserve this.
Thank you so much [g1]. You've made all my dreams come true. I love you too.
I'm still a little sleepy. I could fall asleep like this.
Mmmm... Me too.
I want in on this girls. I feel left out.
Nuh uh, no one gets left out.
Can we stay like this forever? Please?
She said please [mcf]. Means we have to do it.
Bzzzz Bzzzz
What was that?
It's my phone. I think Harper is trying to call me. I'm about to go on a jog with her.
Awwwwh. That's no fun.
Oh, girls. Would you mind coming with me to practice this morning? Stacy has to go and it would be awesome if you two could keep her company.
Of course we can babe.
Yeah, I want to go. I want to see you practice.
Awesome. Thank you girls. I won't be gone very long and when I get back we'll head there, okay?
Okay baby. Have a good jog. I love you.
Don't get outran by Harper too badly. I love you [mcf].
I love you too girls. See you soon.
a few minutes later
There's Harp. Looks like she's getting warmed up.
Harper!
Oh! Thank god you're here. I was starting to worry you weren't going to show.
If I'm being honest, I did forget to set an alarm but I got lucky.
I'll take it. Hey, are we still good to come by your place later today?
Yep, I'd be offended if you didn't come.
Don't worry. Me and Natalie will be there.
I probably shouldn't tell you this but Natalie was so excited you asked her to hang out.
Really? That's great.
She was all smiley and giddy. I even woke up in the middle of the night and I'm a mom so I went to check on her.
She was reading an article about 'How to behave on a first date'... at like 3am.
So thank you for doing that. I hope you two have a great time.
You have an awesome daughter. I'm just happy she's happy to hang out.
She's incredibly happy to. But I have to be a mom for a second.
Now, I know you're a good guy but I have to say a few things.
My daughter is the most important thing to me.
She's a wonderful kid with a big heart. She can be a little too trusting at times.
I won't give you a long speech. Just please don't hurt my daughter.
I understand Harp. I'm not going to do anything to harm her. We're just going to go somewhere and have a good time as friends.
Promise me?
I promise Harper.
Okay, killer eyes mom is at bay.
It's scary how you can flip it like that.
It's the power every mom has.
We're both excited, do we need to bring anything?
No, no. Just bring yourselves.
That we can do.
You ready to jog? We don't have very long so let's get in as much as we can.
Oh, I like the spirit Harp. Let's get it.
One cardio exercise later
You're slowing down Harp!
Hey! I'm not doing bad for a middle aged woman who hasn't ran in a long time.
Ha, true! Hey, does this mean I can skip laps at practice?
What do you think?
Damn... It was worth a shot.
Can we rest for a second?
Yeah, sure.
Phew... I'm not used to that.
It gets easier quickly.
Do you want to do this again?
Yeah, I'm down. I enjoy early mornings and I enjoy spending time with you.
I enjoy every second with you as well [mcf]. That being said... I don't know if I can jog anymore.
That's fine. You definitely shouldn't overdo it.
I might have already, my legs are sore.
Ha, Harp. You should've told me that you were tired.
I know, I didn't want to seem too old though.
It's not an age thing. You just haven't ran in a while. Your body isn't used to it.
Yeah, maybe. I messed up though... I walked here.
It's okay Harp. I can give you a ride home.
Really? That would be amazing [mcf].
Yeah, do you need help getting to my car?
No, it's not that bad.
This is your car??? Damn [mcf].
No, not exactly. Some dealership owns it and they let me drive it.
It's something Charles set up.
It's not in your name? They didn't give it to you?
No, I just drive it.
And Charles is the one who is letting you?
Yep... why?
So you're telling me you stood up to the man offering you cars and homes for the coach who hasn't won a game?
Damn right I did. I'd do it again too.
I like you more than the car anyway. I'd give it back if it meant you would continue to be my coach.
But why [mcf]?
I've had a lot of coaches. Very few did I feel deserved to be where they were. Very few cared about the game or the players.
I can tell you care. I know you're going to give it everything you've got.
I respect the hell out of that. I want to see you succeed and I want to be a part of it.
Thank you [mcf]...
That starts with practice though so let's get you home.
I'm just shocked that you talked to Charles the way you did for me.
I can't really offer any cars...
I don't need cars Harp. I need a good coach. That's why I stood up for you.
Thanks [mcf]...
Let's get going. I'd hate for us to be late to practice.
Thanks for spending your morning with me.
Don't mention it Harp. Any time you want to do this just let me know.
I think my legs will be a bit sore tomorrow. But if they're not would you want to tomorrow?
Yeah, just give me a call.
Awesome.
Oh Harp. I'm bringing Stacy to practice like we talked about... but is it cool if I bring [g1] and Shauna too?
Of course it is! I'd love for them to be there. As long as you don't get distracted.
I won't. I promise. I just want them there so Stacy has someone to talk to.
I understand, yeah that's totally fine with me.
Thanks Harp. You ready to go?
Sure am,
A few minutes later.
Thanks for the ride. I'll see you and all the girls soon.
See you Harper. Tell Natalie I said good morning.
I will. Drive safe.
A few minutes later
Back home. I barely broke a sweat so I won't need another shower.
Babe? Is that you?
Yeah. Where are you?
The shower. Can you come in here for a second?
What is up with this door to a door shit. This house may be nice but being broke made more sense.
Babe?
Ahh! *Smack*
Haha! Told you I'd get you back for spanking me!
Ha, fuck... you got me.
I'm surprised you could hide behind that wall.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that you have hips that I absolutely adore.
Good save. How was the jog?
It went well. Harp got a little tired so I took her home.
Did you see Natalie?
No, I just dropped Harp off.
Oh... Hey, I found a cool room in the basement. Do you want to see it?
Wait... this place has a basement?
Haha, yes. You should really explore a bit.
But there was a door that was jammed, I got it open. Want to see what was inside of it?
I'm a little worried.
Don't be. Come on.
It's this door here. Just head inside.
You betrayed me once yesterday. I'm not about to get Snow'd am I?
Only one way to find out.
Ha, okay. I think I can take you so I'll take the risk.
What the fuck. A home theatre?
Yep, the other girls don't know about it yet.
It's awesome. We definitely have to use this room.
Babe...
Oh... Damn [g1].
Come here baby.
Are you not sore anymore?
No, I still am. But there's other things we can do.
But... can you just hold me for a minute?
Of course babe.
I like this. I know I'm sharing now... but it's nice to just be held by you in a room no one else knows about. Just us.
We can have that babe. A place where only me and you can get in. I don't think it should be here since we could use this room.
Yeah, I know this isn't a long term spot. It's just the spot right now.
You know there's still the other house. That could be ours.
Oh, you're right. We have our own house. Just the two of us.
You and Shauna should have a spot too.
Let's not talk about Shauna right now. I love her too but right now it's about you and me.
Mwah!
My only real worry that was left is that you might forget about me a little bit.
That will never happen babe.
I love you to death. You'll always be my girl and I'll never not give you the attention you deserve.
I love you to death too. Are you ready?
What do you want to do?
I want to give you another blowjob. I think I can do even better than last time.
There is no better babe.
Can I try?
You absolutely can.
[mcf]?? Are you in there?
Yeah mom! I'm in here. Don't co-
Ahh! Oh my god! I'm so sorry!
Get your towel back on babe.
It's okay mom. You didn't mean to.
I feel so embarrassed... I'm so sorry. I'll leave you two.
No mom... wait.
I'm sorry... there goes our spot.
I don't even think she realized what this room was.
I didn't mean to tease you.
You didn't tease babe. You know we could still do it?
I just flashed your mom... We probably shouldn't try this right now.
I understand. You just want to head back upstairs and chill until it's time to go then?
Yes please.
Oh, Shauna must still be getting ready.
Hmmmm...
Do you want to try in here?
Huh? What if Shauna walks in?
Then we'll stop. It's different than if your mom walks in.
I agree with that... but I feel like we were safer in the theatre room.
Yeah... but I just felt a little embarrassed in there.
Now come on. I feel bad for teasing. Sit down.
This is kind of familiar.
Yeah, you thinking of our first time?
Yep, I was so nervous. I'm a lot more confident this time.
I was nervous too.
I'm still not great... but I had no clue what to do with this.
You did pretty damn good.
I winged it.
Well, just keep winging it. Hey... can we try standing up this time?
Sure baby. Stand up and I'll get started.
Oh fuck...
She's immediately going crazy on the head... sucking in, creating suction and she's going crazy with her tongue still.
She has that serious look she gets every time she does this. It's cute how seriously she takes this.
I want to call her on it but I don't want to potentially shake her confidence, it's just really cute.
Holy shit babe... Just like that.
She's definitely more confident now. She's using her hands and just having fun with it.
gl... help.. glk.. me babe...
Help you? Like push you down further?
Mmmmhmmmm...
Glllk...
Ohhhh.. Damn... You're getting so much better so quickly.
Glll.. Further..
Further? Are you sure?
Mhmmm.
Aaaahhhh... You're fucking amazing.
Mmmm... You can... Start.
Start? Like you want me to thrust right now?
Fuck... Communicating like this isn't easy.
Mmmmhmmm.. Fuck my... mouth...
This fucking girl, she can be so sweet and cute and innocent. Then she can hit you with something like that.
You sure you're ready?
Mmhmm..
Glllk.. Glllk...
God damn baby... You're doing so fucking well.
You've grown so much these past few days. At literally everything.
You're like a whole new person.
Glllk.. Faster baby..
Faster? I don't want to hurt you or anything...
Mmmm... Faster.
Gllk.. Gllk..
Jeeeesus.... When did you learn this?
Fuck baby... I'm getting close. Your getting too fucking good at this.
Ahh!
Oh fuck... Sorry Shauna.
Nice outfit though.
I'm so sorry you two. I didn't mean to walk in on you. You should've told me...
It was last second. That's our fault Shauna... not yours.
Sorry baby. Just wasn't meant to happen this morning.
It's okay babe. We'll do it again some other time.
Mwah!
Thanks for all the kind things you said... I couldn't really say thanks then.
I'm just trying to be the best I can be for you.
You keep surprising me baby. I don't think anyone could be any better and then you just one up yourself.
I have a few more things in mind. I'm not done one upping yet.
Oh really? I'm excited and can't wait.
Me neither. We should get dressed so Shauna doesn't have to stand there awkwardly.
True, although she does deserve it after something she pulled this morning.
She told me about that... Hehe, that was messed up.
One awkward... boner stuffing clothes change later
We're decent Shauna. Sorry about that. I'm going to go put on my school uniform.
I'm sorry [g1].
I didn't mean to...
I promise it's fine Shauna.
You must hate me right now, first I tell you I want to wait and then I cockblock you.
I don't hate you at all. We knew it was risky. [am] caught us right before you did.
Really? God, that sucks.
It's not that big of a deal. It's not like we won't be able to finish later.
You look really sexy in your underwear by the way.
Thank you [mcf]
Mwah!
Hey, look at you. Kissing without permission.
Ha, shut up...
I'm going to head downstairs. After you finish getting dressed we'll go ahead and go.
Okay, I'm almost ready. I'll be down in a second.
Damn, [g1] got dressed fast. I guess after flashing two people you'd really want some clothes on.
Hey girls, you about ready to go?
Yep!
Yeah, I'm ready whenever.
Great, where's Elizabeth?
She's up. She finished her shower before I got in.
Awesome, what about [am]?
I saw her head outside.
Outside? Huh... I'll go check on her. When Shauna comes down just head outside.
Sure thing babe.
Mom? Are you okay?
Oh honey... I'm sorry.
It's fine mom. Shauna caught us right after.
That's even worse. I just feel stupid.
I saw you two sneak down there. I should've known. I just wanted to tell you good morning.
Good morning mom.
Good morning honey.
Now don't worry about it. Me and [g1] are fine.
What are your plans for today?
Probably just tidy up the house and relax a bit. Maybe try the pool out again.
That sounds like fun. Hey, I forget if I told you yesterday but my coach and her daughter are going to come by later.
I figured you've been wanting to cook a big meal. Would you mind tonight?
Yes honey. That sounds great. I'll finally get to make you what you told me the other day.
I look forward to it mom. Now head on inside. We're about to leave.
Okay sweetie. I hope you have a good day.
Mwah!
I'll see you soon mom, I hope you have a good day too.
I hope you have a good day too mom. I'll see you soon.
Bye honey. You have a few girls waiting on you.
Huh?
Oh... Hey girls.
Where's Liz?
She said she would be right behind us.
Hmmm. She's being weird. You girls go ahead and just walk slowly. I'm going to check on her and we'll catch up.
Okay, we won't be too far ahead.
Fuck, I hope everything is good with her. I don't even think I've seen her interact with anyone.
Oh... [mcf]. I thought you guys just left.
They did, I stayed back to make sure you're okay.
What do you mean?
Honestly? You don't feel real. I don't mean that to sound harsh. I know you're trying your best but I've barely seen you talk to anyone.
[mcf]... You know I'm not used to this.
I'm just confused with you Liz. We had all of our issues. Then we have that talk before we left our hometown. Then you're in my basement... Ever since then you've made a complete flip into wanting to be a good girl.
I don't want to question your motives. I just want to understand your mindset right now.
Fuck... That's not something I can just jump into talking about.
Can you try?
It's... we have a history. I'm not proud of where it went.
I'm just going to be completely honest with you. I've already told you about mine and [g1]'s father. Well that led to some confidence issues.
Anyway... back when I used to cheer for you. Back before you and my sister were a thing. I had a huge crush on you.
Fast foward a bit and a girl was mocking me for not having a boyfriend. I stupidly told her you were my boyfriend to shut her up. That led to her telling everyone.
Which led to my sister thinking we were together, which led to you two becoming a thing.
Fuck [mcf]... I was jealous. Out of nowhere my sister had what I wanted even after all my years of cheering for you.
Don't get me wrong. I'm happy for you now. I see the effect you've had on her.
But I was pissed... at first. Then I realized acting that way got your attention. So I kept doing it.
Then it felt like that's just who I had to be. That was my new role.
And when I was in your basement and I saw you. I thought you were going to be so pissed... I got really scared.
But then you told me everything was going to be okay. That you didn't blame me and that it's not too late to fix everything.
I needed that [mcf]. I'm still trying... I find myself getting mad for no reason and I don't want to blow it so I try to stay to myself.
Liz... You should've told me all of this sooner. Things didn't have to go like this.
I know. I was dumb.
It's not dumb. You were just mad and scared. I wish I could've been there for you. I would've been.
Yeah, I'm realizing that now too.
Here I was thinking it's because you switched to being a blonde.
Joking right now? Ha, I hate the blonde. I miss my red.
I like the blonde but I miss the red too. Was that a Charles decision?
Yep. Sure was.
He doesn't make those decisions anymore. We should see if you can get it changed back. If you want to.
Yes! Please.
Come on. Let's keep this talk going but we need to start walking so we're not late.
So... what's the plan?
Plan? Didn't even know those existed.
I'm being serious Liz, what's the next step?
I'm not sure [mcf]...
Well then let me help. You have to put yourself out there.
You can't hide from us anymore. Nothing is being solved this way.
But what if I fuck up?
Everyone fucks up. What matters is that people know you're trying. Tell [g1] everything you told me.
Tell her how much you regret it and how you wish you could change things.
Also tell her that you are still battling some issues and that you might act out every now and then.
[g1] is one of the most understanding people on the planet. If she knows you're trying she'll support you all the way.
And so will I. You don't have to be perfect Liz. You just have to give this your best shot.
That easy huh?
You really think [g1] feels the same way you do?
[g1] is blowing my mind everyday. That girl doesn't have a spiteful bone in her body.
As long as you're honest... [g1] will have your back.
Thanks [mcf]... I'm still nervous about it all. But this helped.
I promise I'll talk to her about it.
Good... and if you ever need an outside opinion or advice on anything. [am] is great at that kind of thing.
She's never steered me wrong.
I'm not that close with her though.
It doesn't matter. Just be honest with her. She'll help you in any way she can.
I don't know what to say...
I in no way deserve the way you're treating me. I've been nothing but a bitch to you for years and you're here giving me 3 different support outlets.
I'll say it again, you're family Liz. Just because you made some mistakes doesn't mean you deserve to be ousted.
I see the potential in you. I see the girl who used to blush and look away when I looked at you.
I see a girl who deep down knows she's not the bad guy. I want to help that girl find who she truly is.
That girl is lucky to have you in her life.
So we're agreed? No more hiding?
Yes, no more hiding. I promise.
Even though I really wasn't hiding yesterday... you know.
Haha, I wasn't going to bring that up. I bet you slept well after all of that exercise.
Yeah, real well. After the 13th time.
13? Damn Liz. That's... impressive.
Haha, we shouldn't talk about this though. If [g1] heard us she'd be pissed.
She's still a bit ahead. But you're right.
Are we close to the school?
Yeah, not far at all.
a few minutes later
Hey, I'm gonna go try and find the other cheerleaders.
Okay, they should be in the gym.
It's nice to see [g1] and Harp interact and get along. I feel like Harp is going to be huge part of my life this year.
I'm really starting to care about her as well. I want this team to do well for her.
Haha, and when you jumped on him and we all fell down. That was the highlight of the night.
You girls discussing the biggest betrayal of my entire life?
It's the biggest betrayal until the next thing we have planned.
What's the next thing planned?
You'll find out... soon.
Sorry... it wasn't really a fair fight without me adding to it.
And to be fair she probably thought the big bad basketball star could hold up three dainty girls.
*clears throat* two dainty girls.
Babe... play nice.
What did he say? I couldn't hear him.
He was just being silly.
She started it. Plus we're working on it. She did really well on the jog this morning. 
I'm gonna get out of here before you get attacked. See you out there.
I heard that one... hmmm. I could make you run laps until you're dainty yourself.
I'm just joking around Harp. You know you're fit.
Mmhmmm, tone changes when you think you're going to have to run laps huh?
I'll run the laps. I have quite a few more in me.
I'm just joking around too. My legs hurt too much to even see anyone else run.
That bad?
A little bit. I'm a big girl though I'll be okay. Come on, let's head out.
Shouldn't we wait on everyone?
They'll find us. Come on.
Oh damn Liz. Wasting no time in interacting with [g1].
I never thought I'd see them stand side by side again without being forced to.
Oh! We have a new guy coming today.
Oh yeah? Who?
Ayden. He was one of the guys who asked to tryout. He was tall and said he used to play so I told him to go ahead and come to practice.
Hell yeah, I'll take it.
The actual tryouts will be tomorrow morning. I want you to help.
What do you need me to do?
Just help watch them, see if any of them could help us.
Yeah, sure. I can do that.
Thanks [mcf].
[mcf]!
Damien, what's up?
Tired as fuck. You?
Nothing much, just waiting on everyone.
So, uhhh. What happened to you yesterday?
Sorry about that, stuff came up. I heard you three had a good time though.
No, that's not good enough Damien.
I had to console your girlfriend twice yesterday. Where the fuck were you?
You told me you'd be there too. The least you could have done is let one of us know ahead of time that you wouldn't make it.
I told you. I got busy. That's all you need to know.
That's true. That is all I need to know. But Jasmine?
She was on the verge of tears over you man. I care about you but I care about her too. She didn't deserve that.
All she wanted was to spend time with you. Yet you treated her like she didn't even exist.
She almost cried?
Yeah dude. It's fine that you got busy with... whatever. But the fact you didn't answer anything of hers was way too far.
Me and [g1] did our best to make her have a good time but you could tell she just wanted you.
Fuck... thank you for taking care of her.
I told you. I care about her too.
And hey, we're all human. She just needs to know how you feel.
Yeah, I've been fucking up. I'll settle things.
Good. I'm going to wait on the new guy but you should go ahead and get warmed up. I think we're skipping laps today.
Thank god... Yeah, I'll be over there.
That went about as well as it could have. Damien didn't take it too harshly and he might be able to fix it all.
At least that's over with.
Oh shit...
Jasmine?
Thank you.
You heard all of that?
Mhmmm.
I didn't mean to. I was just walking in when I heard you two talking... and I couldn't help but listen.
Hopefully it helps.
Maybe, I don't know if I care anymore. But... I care about you too [mcf].
We should hang out sometime. Maybe go swimming again.
Yeah maybe.
Fuck, I like Jasmine but I can't do anything with her if she's with Damien.
I have to head to the cheer room. Get everything set up for Liz. But I hope to see you in class.
I'll be there. I'll see you soon Jasmine.
Have a good practice.
Damien, listen...
Is everything okay with you? Jasmine really missed you yesterday.
Yeah man, just busy.
I won't pry. But I'm here for you man. I don't know what you're doing that you have to be secretive about...
I just don't feel like you're being the real you.
Hey, I appreciate it. I'm good though.
I'll explain everything to you and Jasmine soon.
Jasmine sooner than me. She needs to know where you're at.
I know...
Good... I'm going to wait on the new guy but you should go ahead and get warmed up. I think we're skipping laps today.
Thank god... Yeah, I'll be over there.
No closer to anything. Damien still just being strange. I'll assume he has his reasons though.
[mcf]?
Oh, good morning Jasmine.
Good morning. What's up?
Just trying to get everything straight. I feel like ever since I came here everything is slightly off.
I think I know what you mean... 
I have to head to the cheer room. Get everything set up for Liz. But I hope to see you in class.
I'll be there. I'll see you soon Jasmine.
Have a good practice.
[mcf]!
Bailey! How's it going?
Everything is ehh. Not really feeling it today.
Any reason for that?
No, not really. Just feeling a little off.
I hate days like that. Come here.
Oh... [mcf]. This is our first hug...
First hug? Is that a thing people keep track of?
Wait... We hugged when we first met didn't we?
Oh... yeah. I guess you just feel like a different person since then.
Yeah, you feel pretty different too. So fuck it, that was our first hug.
Hehe, good. I should get to the cheer room...
Yeah, probably should. Are the other girls here?
No...
That fucking Willow bitch.
Woah Bailey, what happened?
After school yesterday in the bathrooms...
Well something happened between Willow and Emiko. Zoe stepped in for Emiko and they got into a shoving match.
I think that's all that happened but they got caught. So they can't come to cheer practice or class today.
Damn... Poor Emiko. She talked to me about being worried about mean girls. I told her I'd make sure they wouldn't be mean to her.
Fuck...
No... Emiko started it. She went after Willow.
What? That 5 foot nothing shy girl went after Willow?
Yeah... I don't know what happened though. You'll have to ask her.
Where is she at?
I think she's at Zoe's house. I can send you the address if you want to visit.
Please do that. I want to check on both of them.
You're sweet [mcf]. I'll see you in class.
See you Bailey.
They were right behind me. Should be here any moment.
Cool. I hope you all have a good cheer practice.
Thanks, I hope you have a good practice too. Ours should be easy today. Just have to catch Elizabeth up to everything.
Be good to her. She's a great cheerleader.
I will. I promise.
I'll treat her like family. I'll see you in class [mcf].
See you Bailey.
How cute.
Oh hey Zoe.
And hey Emiko, you're looking great today.
Hehe, thanks.
And what about me?
Not too bad yourself Zoe.
Emiko go ahead and go to our cheer room. I need to talk to [mcf].
Okay...
See you Emiko.
So, what's up?
I was thinking of throwing a party tomorrow night. Would you come if I did?
I might would. I don't know what I have to do tomorrow yet.
Well... I'd really like it if you could come. It's not going to be a big party or anything.
Just the cheerleaders and some of the girls from class.
No guys?
Guys ruin parties. You're the exception.
I'll be there if I can Zoe.
Great, I hope to see you then and I'll see you in class.
See you soon Zoe.
Yo!
Yo!
Are you Ayden?
I am. You're [mcf]?
That's me. It's good to meet you man. It's good to have you on the team.
It's good to be back in a gym. I haven't played since high school.
That's fine. What made you quit on basketball in the first place?
Knee injury, I have a kid back home. He was still in his mom's stomach when it happened.
Had to make a decision. But he's older now and what better way to come back than beside one of the greatest in the country?
Damn... and what a great come back it will be. Is your son here with you?
No, he's back at home with his mom. They're not too far from here though. I visit them on the weekend.
Are you and the mom still together?
Oh yeah, we're engaged. You should meet her sometime.
I'd love to man.
Awesome. It's great to finally meet you.
Babe...
I'll leave you three to it. I'm gonna go say hey to Damien.
Sorry for interrupting... Is it okay if we go back to the cheer room with my sister?
That's perfectly fine. I'm happy you two are getting along.
It's all thanks to you.
Mwah!
We'll be in there if you need us [mcf]. Have a good practice.
Where do you think you're going?
Huh? I'm going with [g1]?
Not before this you're not.
Mwah!
[mcf]!!
Damn, Shauna's face almost matches the color of her hair. That one really got her.
I'll be in the cheer room.
Oh... yeah. Everyone else saw that.
I guess Shauna wasn't ready for it to be out there. Or at least not like this.
All three of them look completely shocked. I guess what we're doing is pretty... out there.
Was that too much?
No, she might be embarrassed for a moment but she'll appreciate how quick you were to show everyone.
I wasn't even thinking about it. I just wanted to kiss her.
That's good. Not caring about how others will view it is exactly what will make this work.
Yeah, I guess that's true.
There's no going back on this now... everyone will know about it.
Good. Everything is going exactly how I wanted it to babe.
I hope you have a good practice. I love you.
I love you too [g1]. I'll see you soon.
We're going to have to talk about that...
But for now go ahead and head over to Ayden and Damien.
Yes Coach.
Both of them?
Yeah... About that...
I'm not one to judge. If you're happy, you're happy.
Anyway... go ahead and head over to Ayden and Damien.
Yes Coach.
What's up guys.
Just seeing what Ayden knows.
How is he?
Best in the world.
Yeah? How's your jump shot?
It's money. Watch this.
Oh fuck...
How can someone jump that high but stay that low?
Buckets!
Completely awful jumpshot, but if he makes it then at least we'll have something to work with.
Fuck...
How long did you say it's been?
A few years... I guess I'm a little rusty.
A little rusty? More like you're a bike that's been left out in the rain for 20 years.
Yeah, I've got some work to do...
We'll get you back in shape man, don't worry.
Okay, I'm ready for whatever I need to do to get there.
Good morning everyone.
It's okay man. No one expects you to come in here and be perfect right off the bat.
The only thing we need from you is to listen and do what we say. Do your best to improve.
You have my word, I'll give this everything I've got.
Good morning everyone.
Good morning Lee. Oh, good morning to you too Mackey.
Good morning.
Who is ready to play?
[mcf]. Talk to me for a moment.
Is Mackey being here a thing you did?
Honestly no, I haven't had the chance to actually talk to him yet. But I'm happy he's here.
Me too... huh. Every positive thing that happens now, I immediately think it's because of you.
And even this probably stems back to you in some way.
Come on Coach. This has a lot to do with you. We went from 3 players to now 5.
And when Ryker shows up we'll have 6.
I forgot about him. Is there any word about where he is?
No, he didn't go to classes yesterday either. Not like he ever did anyway... but still.
Well then maybe he shouldn't be on the team.
It's not that simple...
Well, we can work with what we have here. Hopefully after tryouts we can get a good bench going too.
I think everything is going to work out just fine Harp... I mean Coach.
You really think so?
Yeah, I want to play and see exactly how good these guys are... but I think this is a good start.
Well then go ahead. Test them out.
Yeah? I can do that.
Part of me thought I'd never see Mackey out here. I wonder what changed.
His size will help a ton, if we can keep him coming here. I know Damien can play...
This new guy Ayden has a lot of work to do... but there's some promise there. He has the size and he knows where he needs to be.
Lee is great from the perimeter, he needs to work on pretty much everything else though.
Damien plays a lot how he talked a few days ago. All instinct and no brain.
He just relies on his athleticism. If he learned the nuances of the game he'd honestly be dangerous.
Like right now, he's charging at me and I could do whatever I want. I could make him look silly.
Get him to bite this way, then...
A quick cross should get him off his feet.
Damn, he went down kind of hard. I just meant to shake him a little bit...
Hahaha...
Oh fuck... Jasmine saw all of that. I guess Damien deserves it a bit... but damn.
[mcf] come here.
I could probably get him to slide a bit but there's no need for that.
A quick cut against the way he's leaning should be enough to teach him...
Oh Jasmine, what's she doing out here?
[mcf] come here.
What's going on?
Charles just called. Lauren was coming to tell you but I told her I would tell you for her.
He's at some bus station close to here.
Bus station? Why?
Some emergency something. He has to catch a flight so he needs you to meet him there to have a meeting or something.
Apparently he needs a bus to go to the airport. I don't know.
Oh okay... Thanks for telling me.
No problem. All the girls say hi by the way.
What's going on you two?
Charles is going on some flight and needs to see me now.
Oh... well I guess there's not much of a choice.
I'm going to get back to cheer.
See you Jasmine. Thanks again.
Well... practice is still a bit dysfunctional huh?
I'm sorry. This should all be cleared up and then I won't be a distraction anymore.
Hey, it's okay. I know you want to be here.
Plus you're going to need to be here earlier tomorrow morning anyway. So half an hour off today for an extra hour tomorrow.
Tryouts are that early?
No, but there's some stuff I have to do and I need your help.
I got you Harp. I'll be here as early as you need me.
Good, now go ahead before Charles gets antsy. I'll see you after school.
Yes you will. See ya soon Harp.
Time to find Stacy.
Oh, she's already out here.
You ready Stacy?
Oh hey, yeah I'm ready.
I'm sorry we didn't watch you practice...
It's fine. I know you hate basketball.
I don't hate it. There's just some bad memories.
Oh, I didn't know. I thought you just weren't a fan.
No, I actually like to play. It's just... yeah.
Do you want to talk about it?
You'd want to? Well, maybe.
Not now though. Maybe tonight.
Whenever you want to Stacy.
Okay, yeah. Tonight then. Now let's go. We have to go to some bus station right?
Yep, I know where it is though... it's not far. So just follow me.
5 minutes later
Yep, there they are...
Both of them give off this completely creepy vibe.
Charles...
Ahh, there they are.
Here we are. So what do you need to know?
Woah, what's with the edge? We're all friends here.
That's what this is? I get accused of assault by the guy who hit me and put me in his basement and we're all friends here?
That's not what this is about son.
Fuck... something about him calling me son got me instantly pissed.
I have to stay cool.
That's not what this is all about. We're just here to make sure everyone is okay.
This fucking guy is just staring down Stacy. I don't even think she notices.
How about me and you go talk and leave them two to sort out their side of it?
Oh... I see. This was all a way for this asshole to meet back up with Stacy. She did say he was acting creepy.
Nah, I'm not leaving her with him.
Whatever needs to be said can be said between all of us.
Right Stacy?
Uhh... yeah sure.
[mcf]... Work with me here.
It's okay old man. We're good here. The kitten doesn't want to play fetch.
I no longer regret knocking this guy out... at all.
Are you sure?
Yeah this is a waste of our time. I'm out of here.
[mcf]... can you not help me out sometime?
Charles... What are you talking about?
That was my nephew. His whole plan was to get you here to ask about her.
Then you brought her here so I thought everything would go smoothly.
Charles. She doesn't want to be around him. She said he was creepy and she helped me so I'm helping her out by keeping him away from her.
It has nothing to do with you. I came here to clear this up and now it is. Nothing else.
Okay...
Fuck, I knocked out Charles' nephew. I must really mean a lot to this place if that doesn't get me in trouble.
Charles seems genuinely upset that I'm not being a bro with him. I think he might actually just be a bit dumb and not some evil guy.
Okay Charles. Look, we've been stepping on eachother's toes. There's a simple solution to this.
Our involvement needs to be just us. You keep trying to effect those that I care about. If you want to be friends we can be.
But it will never come at the expense of others. We should hang out sometime. Just us two, no one else and hash this all out. Agreed?
Fine, yeah. That sounds like a good time. I'll talk to you when I get back about setting that up.
Fuck... that mood change was instant. This dude isn't all there. He can't be.
Bye Charles.
What happened [mcf]? I couldn't understand what you guys were talking about. Are you going to be in trouble?
No Stacy. That guy was just being a creep.
He had me bring you here so he could talk to you again. That's all this was.
But I wasn't going to let that happen. That guy is too much of a weirdo.
Really? But it could've gotten you in trouble...
Stacy, do you really think I'd throw you at them just to save me a little headache?
I don't know...
Well I wouldn't... ever. You helped me out when you had no reason to.
That means a lot to me. You have a kind heart Stacy. I'd fight them both if it meant you'd be safe.
Oh... Damn Stacy you're choking me.
Oh, sorry...
I just... thank you [mcf].
I was so nervous about coming here to this school... not knowing anyone. I was afraid someone would try to take advantage of me.
That's what people will do to those with kind hearts. You have to be careful.
But my kind heart is why I'm here now. With someone who will look out for me.
Not to mention the arsenal of girls you have that would look out for me too.
That's true. I guess we both got lucky then.
I can agree to that.
Is that you [mcf]?
Rachael? What are you doing here?
Business kid, it pulls me around the globe. I didn't expect to see you in here.
This is crazy. Small world huh.
Are you going to introduce me to your girlfriend?
Oh uh, this is just my friend... but her name is Stacy.
Hey, I'm going to let you two talk. I'll be over here.
You don't have to, you're free to talk with us.
I know, I'm just a little emotional right now.
Oh, uhm. Okay. Just stay in sight. I don't know if that creepy guy is still around.
I will.
Sit with me [mcf].
So how's college going?
Hold on, have you heard anything from my mom?
Yes I have. That's a lot to get into right now though.
Okay, just whenever you have time.
Yeah, college is going well.
I bet you've been having fun. Brand new place full of brand new women.
Yeah it's been crazy.
Tell me... how many?
How many what?
How many girls from the college have you been with?
Come on there's no way you haven't been with at least one.
I haven't Rachael.
Why the hell not kid? That girlfriend of yours holding you down?
No actually. She kind of told me that I'm allowed to be with whoever I want to be with.
Damn... you got a keeper.
So why haven't you been with any of these girls?
I don't know. They're all friendly to me but it's not like that.
Have you tried to make it like that?
Not exactly.
You're not always going to get girls that will throw themselves at you like I did.
You're not always going to get girls that will throw themselves at you like I tried to.
You have to be the initiator. None of the girls your age want to appear easy. But give them a little push and who knows where they will go.
Yeah, I get that. This whole new relationship thing is still new to me.
I understand that... hey.
How's [am] doing?
She's doing great. You should come by and see her.
Yeah, I will. I miss her.
Letting her leave was one of the hardest things I've done in a long time.
Really?
Yeah, your mom is awesome. Was always there for me and knew how to make me laugh.
I could never get her to hang out with me but I'd still say she was my best friend.
Dang Rachael. I'm surprised you let her go without a fight.
I know how to pick my battles. I heard for years pretty much daily about her amazing son.
She would always brag about you. All the other moms shit talked their kids but never her.
So when the woman who I think could do no wrong is so amazed by someone. I took note of that.
Part of me thought she might be exaggerating, but when I met you... you acted exactly how she described you.
That's a big reason I was so... you know.
That's not like me kid. I've never even flashed a boob for a guy until he's at least spent hundreds in drinks on me.
So if you had that pull on me, I can't imagine what you could accomplish with these college girls.
But yeah, there was no way she was going to stay. I didn't even want to try and make her.
I didn't know you had such a nice side to you Rachael.
You don't know most of my sides... yet.
You haven't forgotten about that thing we planned on the phone the other day right?
The three person party?
I can't say I have. Is that still a thing?
Yep, I'll message you tonight, before I come over.
Sounds good to me.
It fucking better. See you soon kid.
See you Rach.
I need to get going though. I'll come by sometime tonight. We have a lot to talk about.
I'm sure we do. I'll see you soon Rach.
See you kid.
You ready to go Stacy?
Sure... uhh, who was that lady?
My mom's old boss... Are you okay now, or still feeling emotional?
A bit, I just am happy to be where I am right now.
I'm happy you're here too. Now, let's get to class.
5 minutes later
Oh awesome, the girls are already here.
Girls! We're back.
Welcome back.
How'd everything go babe? Are you okay?
Yeah, it was strange but everything is settled.
Good. That's nice to know.
So... Shauna. Sorry about earlier.
I kind of forgot where we were. I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that.
No, no. That was fine.
I'm happy that you didn't mind kissing me in front of everyone. It just shocked me.
Good. I'm happy everyone knows now. Did the other girls ask about it?
They sure did.
What did you tell them?
That it's up to you who you want to be with. They had a lot of other questions but I didn't really answer them.
I'm sorry for dumping that on you.
I know you didn't mean to, plus it was funny seeing them all clamor about it.
Haha, I bet it was.
My favorite students!
Hey Veronica, I thought teachers weren't meant to have favorites?
Don't tell on me.
Haha, your secret is safe.
So uhh... Are you still on for meeting my nephew today?
Oh fuck... I forgot about that.
Uhh... Absolutely. I might not be able to stay for long but I'll absolutely meet him and play with him for a bit.
That's perfect. Thank you so much again [mcf].
Don't mention it. I'm happy to meet him. Is it still a surprise?
Mhmmm, he thinks he's just going to the gym to play.
Perfect. I hope he freaks out.
I can guarantee you he will.
I'm going to be the best aunt in the world.
I'll make sure he knows it was all you that set it up.
Oh, that would be perfect.
Are you ready for class to start?
Sure am... well actually can I be excused for a moment?
Well yeah. Class hasn't started yet and won't for a bit. You're free to do whatever. Thank you for being polite though. Just be back before class starts.
Yes ma'am.
Where even is the nearest bathroom?
Oh hey Rainn and Bailey.
Hi.
Where are you running off to?
Trying to find a bathroom.
I can show you.
That would be awesome. Thank you.
Hey... you should come by the diner today.
I'm not sure if I'll have time today Rainn. If I do I'll be there though.
Great. See you then.
So... bathroom. There's one down the hall... I think.
Lead the way.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Just thinking.
Thinking about what?
[g1] told us about your two's relationship. I'm just thinking about all the girls that are going to come at you.
All the girls that are going to flutter their lashes at you.
Rachael told me to be more assertive. This seems like a good time to try it out.
Yeah? Are you one of them?
Damn, that got her. She's getting as red as Shauna got.
I'm actually not sure if I want to pursue other girls yet. But flirting never hurt anyone.
I'm just playing with you Bailey.
No reason to turn into a tomato.
Haha, shut up.
She clearly likes me. I like her to, but do I want to pursue something with her?
Hey Bailey.
Yeah?
I like you too.
Haha, right back into a tomato.
Are you being serious?
Yeah Bailey. I think you're awesome. I love your personality and you're as cute as can be. So yeah, I like you.
Follow me.
Uhh... This isn't a bathroom.
No, sorry. I'll take you to one in just a second. I just wanted a moment alone with you.
Yeah? I don't mind that. How do you want to spend this moment?
You just told me you liked me dude. I haven't exactly been shy about liking you...
So I figured we should have a moment to...
What? Hug? Kiss?
The last one.
Yeah? I think I want that too.
I don't know why but I just want to tease her. Maybe it's how she reacts but it's so tempting.
Well... What are you waiting for?
I'm just enjoying this moment.
Mwah!
You were taking too long...
Haha, fair... But that's it? A little peck?
Huh? You want to do more?
More than a friendly kiss? Yeah, I do.
Well, I uhh... Don't know.
All right, no more teasing now. Time to go all out.
This seemed to work on [g1] and Shauna... hopefully it works on her too.
She's going with it... when I did it to the other girls they just sort of let it happen.
But Bailey is pushing her tongue further and moving it around...
Wow...
Yeah, that was much better than what I did.
Was it good for you?
It was great Bailey.
Good... did you want to do anything else?
That's up to you Bailey, we should get back to class soon though.
Yeah... Uhh... What would you do with [g1]?
Right now? There's a lot I would do. For some reason I really like picking her up.
The way her face lights up and she gets a goofy smile... so yeah. I'd pick her up and lay her on that table.
Can we do that?
Yeah... but I mean that usually leads to something else.
I know, but there's no harm in just doing the first part.
Well, when you put it like that.
Oh! [mcf]...
Damn Bailey, you're light.
You picked me up like I'm nothing...
You weigh nothing... do you not like it?
No! I like it. It's just a weird feeling.
Weird how?
It's like a powerless feeling, I'm just a tiny girl and you could fling me around like it's nothing.
Mmm, Bailey sounds like she likes being a bit submissive...
I definitely wouldn't mind exploring that side of her...
I'm basically pressing her against me and she doesn't seem to mind at all.
Although I should really lay her down, I've just kinda been holding her here doing nothing.
Oh! We're ruining this table.
We just knocked over a lamp... it's fine.
But what if someone walks in?
I don't think they would care about the lamp as much as they would us laying on their desk.
I know... it's just this is great and I don't want this to end in me being embarrassed...
We can stop now Bailey.
Are you sure? I don't want to make you mad...
Mad? Come on Bailey.
I told you I liked you because well... I like you.
You have a nice personality. I can tell you care about those around you.
Not to mention you're cute as hell. I like your smile and your big brown eyes.
I didn't tell you it so we could fool around in some office. So yes... we can stop.
Thank you [mcf]...
Woah... what are you doing Bailey?
Fuck... that actually feels really good.
After getting interrupted this morning twice... I wouldn't say no to this.
She's a petite girl. Which actually fits her really well. I can tell she has perky nipples though.
I can feel them even through her bra.
This thumb action is nice but it's time to move onto something else.
Hey! I was sucking on that... Give it back.
We really don't have much time Bailey. Let's do something else.
What do you want to do?
Flip around.
Like on my knees? What are you going to do?
Yeah, on your knees. I just want to look at you.
Uhhm... okay...
Mmm, she's got the perfect amount of butt and thigh for her frame. I wonder what she looks like underneath the underwear.
That's surely too much for right now though.
I do wonder just how ready she is though...
So? Enjoy the view?
Oh yeah... she's ready. Her panties are wet and it feels like there's a tiny oven down here.
Oh! I guess you are enjoying it... hehe
Sorry Bailey... I couldn't resist. You're just really fucking sexy.
Can I see you out of your uniform?
Can I keep my underwear on? We're not really in a safe place.
Yeah, I just want to see you without this in the way.
Can you check and make sure no one is coming and that the door is locked while I take it off?
Sure, yeah I can do that.
Door is locked and it seems everyone is already to their class. Hallway seems empty.
Hopefully Veronica doesn't mind us being a few minutes late...
Okay, I'm ready.
How do I look?
Perfect. You just ooze 'girl I want to protect but also take home at night'.
Stand up... let me get a better look.
I'm not too boyish? I know I'm not very curvy... Not like [g1] or Shauna.
Curves are nice... you have some yourself. But when a girl can be petite and pull it off so well... it's fucking sexy.
The only way you could get better right now is if your ass is how I'm imagining it.
Small and firm... but cute. Can you turn around?
Oh yeah... exactly how I thought it was.
And a nice thigh gap to boot.
I'm glad you like my body... I know I like yours.
After seeing you with Liz... well I don't know if I could handle that thing.
You talked a big game back then.
I told you... that was all Zoe telling me what to do.
Yeah, maybe... you can't fake the look you had in your eyes though.
Yeah? Was it like the look I have now?
Close... you looked a bit more conniving before.
I very much prefer where you are now to where you were then though.
So do I. And maybe I'll have that same look when I see it again.
There's nothing stopping you... go for it.
Oh my fucking god [mcf]...
What? You've seen it before.
It's different when it's right in front of my face.
There's no way that would ever fit in me.
There's other ways... for now at least.
You can grab it... if you want to.
Yeah, I want to... There's a lot I want to do.
Like what exactly?
Well... I'd firstly like to not be in this office so we'd have privacy.
So would I...
If we weren't here though. I would want to taste it...
I mean... you could try that now. Not much difference than what we're doing now.
True... Well...
I'd do it like this.
This fucking tease... she's just blowing warm breath on it.
My cock is twitching just waiting for her to do something.
I'd get you all riled up... and then I would...
Oh would you look at the time! We should get to class.
Fuck me... I live in a world full of tease and interruptions.
I'm sorry... that was kind of mean. But if we started this there's no way we wouldn't be extremely late.
Bailey...
What? Please don't be angry with me... we just don't have time. I'm sorry, that was a bad joke...
I promise I'll make it up to you. I just don't want to be late and... when I got down there I got a little nervous.
I'll make things better soon. Just don't be angry at me please.
Mwah!
You're right. We need to get to class. But first...
I want to say that I'm happy we did this. I'm happy I met you and that we are already where we're at. You're awesome Bailey.
[mcf]... I'm happy too. Incredibly so.
Great, now can you please show me the bathroom before class?
Oh, haha... I completely forgot about that. Yeah, let's get dressed and then I'll show you.
Awesome, thanks Bailey.
A few minutes later
Here we are...
Thanks again Bailey.
No problem... hey... I have a question.
What's up?
Are you going to tell [g1] and Shauna about me?
Yeah, I intend to. Are you okay with that?
Yes! I like you... and I don't want you to have to hide me.
I would never hide a girl as beautiful as you Bailey.
Hehe, I'm going to go ahead and head back to class. I want to tell Rainn about what happened... if that's okay.
I don't mind. Like I said, no hiding.
See you in class Bailey.
See you [mcf].
So... should we get back to class?
Yeah, we should. After you show me that bathroom.
Oh, haha. I completely forgot about that. Yeah I'll show you. Follow me.
A few minutes later
Here we are...
Thanks Bailey.
[mcf]... I'm glad you told me. I'm very happy about things.
I am too Bailey. I'm excited for everything to come with us.
Are you going to tell [g1] and Shauna about me?
Yeah, I intend to. Are you okay with that?
Yes! I like you... and I don't want you to have to hide me.
I would never hide a girl as beautiful as you Bailey.
Hehe, I'm going to go ahead and head back to class. I want to tell Rainn about what happened... if that's okay.
I don't mind. Like I said, no hiding.
See you in class Bailey.
See you [mcf].
Here we are...
Thank you Bailey.
No problem [mcf].
I'm going to go ahead and head back to class. Make sure I'm not late and all.
Good idea, see you Bailey.
See you [mcf].
One bathroom visit later
Okay, time to head back to class.
Oh shit, it's Penelope. I should say hey to her... especially after yesterday at the diner.
Penelope! What's up?
Oh, hey [mcf]. What are you doing over here right now?
I had to use the restroom before class.
You know there's one like right next to the classroom right?
Uhh, no... I didn't. Bailey showed me this one.
I think she just wanted to spend some time with you. This is probably the bathroom furthest away from our class.
Which works out for me since I can walk you back.
That's perfect... because I'm a little lost.
Haha, follow me.
So... I heard a little rumor about you.
I think I know what it is.
I think everyone knows what it is by now. Is it true? You're with Shauna?
And [g1]. That spread really quickly.
Yeah... I wouldn't doubt that they are talking about it on national news right now. I mean that's how I found out everything I know about you.
But it could be way worse... you could be the guy that had the imaginary girlfriend.
Haha, well having two is better than having none.
Hey Penelope...
Call me Penny. I liked it when you did yesterday.
Really? I assumed you probably get called that all the time and that it might have been annoying.
No, I've been called it a lot before... but I like it when you do it.
Penny it is then. I just wanted to say that I like this smiley version of you more than the one trying to hide from me.
Yeah, I do too...
What about the version of me without glasses?
I like both the glasses and no glasses.
I like myself without them more... I just can't see as well.
You have nice eyes that the glasses hide a bit, but I'd value eyesight over that.
Anyway... I think it's really cool that you're with Shauna.
With everything I've read... it seems like you were her protector.
If I had someone like you growing up, I could imagine myself being in love with them.
So I'm happy for you both.
You being who you are... being with a girl like Shauna. That's a big deal.
It's actually huge. Especially since you were open about it, not doing it in secret.
She had you growing up to protect her and now she has you in a different way.
I'm happy for you both.
Thanks Penny.
Sooo... it's none of my business but have you and Shauna done anything yet?
That's a pretty personal question to ask someone you just met yesterday.
Sorry... I feel like I've known you for a long time since I've read a ton about you.
I don't think I'm going to tell Penny about me cheating before I tell [g1]...
But I can tell her that we decided to take things slowly.
Uhh... no we haven't. We've talked about it and decided we will take things slowly. All this is new still.
I understand that. Sorry for being nosy.
It's fine. It helps that I'm not a very secretive person. I'd appreciate if you didn't tell Shauna that we talked about this though.
I won't. I still haven't even met her.
I'll introduce you now if you'd like.
Yes please.
Before we do that I have one final question.
What's up?
When you and Shauna do decide to do things... are you going to do anything with her dick?
Woah, more very personal questions...
Sorry, I can't help myself from asking.
Yeah, uhh... I'm not sure Shauna would be into that.
What makes you say that?
Just how she talks about things, she fully sees herself as a girl.
Oh... well that works out perfectly for you then. Unless you were interested in her that way.
I respect Shauna as she is. I don't mind that she has it at all. She's still as much of a girl as every other girl to me...
But I'm not really into that.
That's fair. Sounds like it works out for the both of you as well.
I might be, I'm not really sure yet.
Yeah? Wow... that's awesome.
Not that it really matters. I really don't think Shauna would be down for anything like that.
Why is that? She just might not be comfortable with that side of her. She's probably scared of what you think about it.
You should try easing into things... maybe get her to touch herself for you. Things like that.
But if she's not down then obviously stop trying and accept her feelings.
Of course. I'll give it a shot. Thanks Penny.
No problem, I'm happy to help.
But yeah... I want to meet her.
Let's go meet her then.
[mcf]! We need to talk!
Okay... I'll be in the class in a second Penny. Just wait for me okay?
Sure... I'll be in there.
What do you need Willow?
You owe me.
I owe you? What for?
You knocked my boyfriend out yesterday. You owe me big time.
Woah... that guy is your boyfriend? Explains a lot.
Plus after what you said about [g1] yesterday... I'd say we're even now.
Come on... a little banter isn't as bad as knocking someone out.
He sucker punched me first Willow, I don't owe you or him anything.
Why was that guy trying to talk to Stacy so badly if he's with Willow?
I should keep that to myself though. I don't want Stacy to be a target for Willow.
You owe me.
What do you think I owe you.
Good, you admit it. I'll let you know soon.
I didn't admit to anything. I don't owe you anything.
I said I'll let you know soon [mcf]. Have fun in class.
This fucking girl... why can't she just be easy going like all the others. I get the feeling she'll be nothing but a headache.
I'll worry about that later though. Not worth it right now.
Oh shit, Shauna looks like she's out.
She did say she barely slept last night...
Maybe I should meet her some other time.
No, I'll get her up. Just give me a second.
Shaaaunaaaa... You need to get up. Class is about to start.
.....
Well, I guess she's too sleepy to go to the arcade today...
Ughhhh...
I'm up, I'm up...
Heh, you look really cute when you're sleepy eyed.
And you look very handsome when you tell me I'm cute.
What did you say about the arcade?
Nothing, I was just joking about not going. But we definitely are.
And you're going to win me the biggest stuffed animal they have.
That's right.
I can't wait... [g1] said that she's going to stay home and let the two of us go.
Really? Why did she say that?
So we both get some alone time today. After we get back she said she wanted some time alone with you.
Oh that works then. You should really take a nap before we go though.
I will, whenever we go home.
Sounds good... so Shauna there's a girl I want you to meet.
Sure... but first.
Mwah!
I get to do the shock kissing this time.
Haha, that's fair. We're even now.
So who am I meeting?
Penelope. She's waiting on us in the center of the class.
Oh. Let's talk to her then. Didn't mean to make her wait.
Hi Penelope... it's nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you too Shauna. I don't want to sound weird but...
I did a lot of research on [mcf]... there were articles about you two and it turns out that me and you have a lot in common.
So I wanted to meet you.
Oh... well that's nice of you.
You two should hang out sometime. I think you two will get along.
Yeah maybe.
I'm going to go sit down now. Thanks for introducing us.
No problem Penny. I might swing by the diner later.
I hope you do. See you.
Fuck... this meeting was a little awkward.
So... how do you know her?
I stopped for a burger yesterday at a diner. She worked there and we talked for a minute.
She was nice and mentioned you. So I figured you two should meet.
How did she know about me?
She said some old interviews I did. Or some article or something. I'm not sure exactly.
What did she mean she's like me?
I think she meant she was bullied at a young age too. She mentioned that she didn't have someone like me.
I thought it might be cool to know another girl that has gone through everything you have.
It is... I kind of like being that girl that you protect. It seperates me from the rest.
Shauna, I never said I was doing anything with her. I just wanted you two to meet. She's just a friend.
You have a ton of things that seperate you from every other girl. I'll protect any girl I'm with though.
I don't view you any differently based on that. I view you differently based on everything we've been through.
Nothing will ever change that and no one will ever rival that.
Is she like me? You know...
Yeah she is. I thought it might be cool to know another girl that is going through everything you are.
It is... I just like being the only one in your life. It seperates me from the rest.
Shauna, I never said I was doing anything with her. I just wanted you two to meet. She's just a friend.
You have a ton of things that seperate you from every other girl. That isn't one of them though.
I don't view you any differently based on that. I view you differently based on everything we've been through.
Nothing will ever change that and no one will ever rival that.
You're right... I'm just being weird. I'm not used to any of this yet.
Not used to calling you mine, or sharing you. Any of it.
It's still weird to me too Shauna. It will become more natural with time I think.
Yeah... it should. I'll talk to Penelope again sometime soon.
Thanks Shauna. I think it would be good for both of you if you were to be friends.
Babe?
I'll let you two talk. I'm going to lay my head down for as long as I can.
Okay Shauna. I'll wake you before class starts.
That was a long bathroom trip. What happened?
Bailey took me to one far away.
Bailey? She's the girl with the shaved side in her hair right?
Yeah, that's her.
Oh, she seems nice. She's pretty too. Did you two do anything?
I thought you didn't want to know about things like that unless I wanted them to be a part of us?
Yeah... I kinda like hearing about it though. Come on... tell me.
I was being a little flirty with her. Got her to indirectly admit she liked me. Then I told her I liked her too.
After that we went into someone's office and kissed a bit. That's all.
Do you plan to do more?
Is it a bad thing if I do?
No baby. I want you to. Thanks for telling me.
We didn't do anything. I'm pretty sure she likes me but I think I just want her to be my friend.
Why? She seems lovely.
She is, there's just something not there though. Can't force things.
I guess so. Thanks for telling me the truth.
Of course, and thank you for... well everything.
The way she immediately grabbed my arm is so fucking adorable.
No thanks needed. You deserve everything.
Mwah!
Hey! I talked to Shauna.
I told her that I'm going to stay back while you two go to the arcade and that I wanted some time alone with you after.
Yeah she told me about that.
That way we can finish what we started earlier.
Maybe more?
Definitely more.
I hate to interrupt the cute couple but there's someone you need to meet real quick [mcf].
I'm going to sit down with the girls while you do that.
Okay, I'll be over there in a second.
Sorry about that. There's actually two girls you haven't met yet. Elizabeth and Kimmy.
Oh, I actually already know Elizabeth. Known her most of my life.
But yeah, I need to meet Kimmy.
Oh, I didn't know that about you two. But Kimmy is right here.
Kimmy, this is [mcf].
It's nice to meet you.
Mhmm, you too.
I'll leave you two to it.
So, tell me about yourse-
Stop right there, let me say a few things.
I don't know what the praise or hype is about for you. You don't seem special to me.
I don't know why you're in our class. I just don't get it.
Woah, Kimmy. What's the hostility for?
What isn't it for? You ruined everything.
What do you mean? What did I do?
Ugh, you don't even know. Listen, we're going to have to work together.
If you don't have to talk to me then don't. That will make this year go as smoothly as it can.
Kimmy, talk to me for a second.
Fuck, what did I do to her?
What did she mean we'll have to work together?
Everyone take your seats! Class is starting.
Well, I need to focus on class for now. But I'll get to the bottom of that.
One class session later
Good job today everyone. [mcf]... are you still good to meet my nephew?
Sure am.
Okay, I'm going to get changed really quickly. Wait here.
Oh? What about her nephew?
Sorry for not telling you sooner. I kind of forgot.
I'm going to go meet her nephew, he's a fan. I won't be gone long.
That actually works out really well. I was going to take Elizabeth to get her hair dyed back red.
Really? That's great. Are you going to get your nails done?
I might, I don't know.
You should... and get them painted black this time.
I told her the same thing.
Man, Liz worked quickly on getting closer with [g1]. It's really nice seeing them get along.
Okay, I'll think about it. We shouldn't be too long either though.
Well, I'll see you two soon then.
See you [mcf].
Bye baby.
What about you two girls?
I'm going to go home and sleep a bit.
I'll see you soon [mcf]. Wake me up whenever you're ready to go.
I will Shauna. See you soon and sleep well.
What about you Stacy?
I should probably finally find out about my dorm. Meet my roommate and all that.
Why? You can just come to our house again.
I can't just crash there everyday, I need to find out about where I have to stay.
You can stay at our place for as long as you want Stacy. We have the room and we like having you there.
Are you sure? I really don't want to impose.
Yes really. I want you there Stacy.
Thank you so much [mcf]. I really didn't want to have to do all that with my dorm.
I'm scared my roommate would be a jerk.
Don't worry about that. Just move your stuff into our place.
[mcf]... we've only been friends for a day.
So? Don't you like it at my place? It's basically just a big dorm room.
Yeah, I do. But...
No buts. You like it there. We like you being there. So you should be there.
Okay... yeah. If you insist.
I do, do you need help moving your stuff?
No, I don't have a whole lot.
Well good. So you're going to head to our place now?
Hehe, yeah. Do you need me to do anything?
Just check on [am] for me. I know she's not used to staying home alone all day.
Yeah I can do that.
Thanks Stacy. I'll see you at home soon. You should catch up with Shauna and walk home with her.
Okay I will, see you at home.
After all the help Stacy has been and how nice she is. I'm happy she'll be staying with us.
[mcf]? You're still here?
Yep, about to head out though.
You decide if you're going to come by the diner today yet?
Same as before, if I have time I will.
Well, I hope to see you then. Bye [mcf].
Where do you think you're going?
I don't know, I don't want to bug you too much today.
You're not bugging me. The only thing that bugs me is that you were going to leave without a kiss.
Well let's fix that.
Oh damn Bailey. That's definitely no friendly peck.
Better?
Way better.
Good, now I better see you at the diner later. Or else that will bug me.
I'll definitely try to be there.
Grr, I'll take it. See you [mcf].
See you Bailey...
I like how things are progressing with her. Feels natural.
So you and Bailey huh?
Oh hey Rainn. Yeah, she told you? I'm assuming.
Of course she did, we're best friends. She tells me everything.
You're cool with it all?
Yeah but...
If you hurt her... whatever you do to her I'll do to you.
Heh, noted.
Have a good day Rainn.
Likewise [mcf].
Veronica should be back any second. I can't spend much time with her nephew but I'll try to make it fun.
See you Bailey. Take care.
Hmm, that was a bit distant of her. I hope she didn't expect anything from me earlier.
Anyway Veronica should be back any second. I can't spend much time with her nephew but I'll try to make it fun.
[mcf]? How's it going?
Oh hey Jasmine.
Damn, Kimmy is with her and looks as pissed as earlier.
She's even pulling Jasmine back.
Oh... uhh. I'll talk to you later [mcf].
See you soon Jasmine.
What was that about? What's gotten into you?
I'll tell you in a minute.
Well at least I can probably find out what's up with Kimmy through Jasmine.
Oh good. You're still here. You ready to go?
Jesus, there's just girls popping up everywhere.
But damn Veronica. I didn't realize she had a body like that.
How old is she anyway? She doesn't seem a day past 30.
Hello?
Oh, sorry. I was just a little shocked.
Shocked about what?
Honestly, I didn't realize you had the body that you have.
Oh... [mcf]. You shouldn't say those things, especially not in this hallway.
Sorry, I don't mean it in that way, just a compliment.
Thank you... but please keep that to yourself, after last year I can't have a student talk to me like that.
But really... thank you.
Won't happen again Veronica. We good to go?
Yeah, we can go.
A few minutes later.
Doesn't look like they are here yet.
Well then let's take a seat.
Sure...
Thanks for coming here again. There's no kid that deserves this more than Nathan.
No problem Veronica. I'm happy to be here.
That kid has been through so much this year.
His father went to jail on some drug charge. Him and his mom had to move twice since then.
His mom has been doing her best but it's got to be hard, she still hasn't told him where his dad is.
That's awful. I assume he asks her all the time about him though?
Oh yeah, it must be stressful for her.
I was the same way but it was about my mom. Poor kid.
That's why I'm very grateful for you coming here.
I hope it helps everyone out. He's such a sweet kid.
What are you two doing here?
Oh shit, it's the nurse that saw me when Natalie landed on me.
Oh, it's you. How are you feeling?
I'm good. Thanks for helping me out that day.
I didn't really do much.
Sorry kid, I'm a hugger.
Okay, she's squeezing pretty tight. She's pressing herself against me. She's pretty firm for an older woman.
Would you mind if me and Veronica talk alone for a second?
Oh, yeah sure. I don't mind.
It's okay, just give us a second. You should hide behind the bleachers and make it a surprise.
That sounds like fun. I'll be back there.
That was a bit strange, I wonder what they had to talk about.
What are you doing here with him?
Oh shit, sound travels in this gym. I can hear them still.
He's here to meet my nephew. I was surprised he agreed to it. Hell he's the one who brought it up.
Oh, I thought you might have been here on a little secret visit.
No, after everything that happened last year... there's no way.
I don't know... I've never seen you wear clothes like this.
What? Workout clothes? I came here to play basketball with my nephew.
Hmmm, I don't think you need skin tight everything to play basketball.
Haha, shut up.
I wouldn't blame you if you were here for him.
He had a little accident the other day and I had to check on him. Some girl kneed him in the groin.
Oh, I didn't know that happened. I hope he's okay.
Trust me, he is. He fell asleep in the nurse room and I was just doing my job.
Checking on my patient and everything. Took a little peek.
You didn't! That's messed up!
Couldn't help myself. Just yeah, he's totally fine.
What the fuck...
If his girlfriend hadn't shown up he might've woken up to me instead of her.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
All that man has to do is ask and I'd do whatever he wanted.
Okay, okay. I got it. You're really perverted you know that?
Yeah, I know it. It's my best trait.
Knock, knock, knock
Oh shit, that must be Nathan. It's my time to shine.
I'm just going to ignore everything that nurse just said.
Hey auntie.
Hey Nathan. You ready to play?
Yeah! Mom said I can't stay very long though. She's going to the store then she's going to pick me back up.
Aah. Oh well. We'll make the best of the time we have.
Damn, Veronica has a nice ass too. And if I'm being honest with myself the nurse doesn't have a bad one either.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Who?
That sounds like my cue.
Hey Nathan. It's nice to meet you.
Oh my god! Are you [mcf]?
Yes Nathan, that's [mcf].
Your aunt told me you were a fan. So I just had to meet you.
So you should thank her. I wouldn't be here without here.
Thank you so much auntie.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Isn't that just the cutest thing.
Thank you [mcf].
Damn, her voice was shaky saying that. This really does mean a lot to her.
I'm going to head back to my neck of the woods. I just have some last minute things before I go home.
You should come by sometime [mcf].
Uhh, maybe. I might.
Bye kid.
Are we going to play any?
We sure are buddy. But first I need the strongest high five you can give me.
Go ahead Nathan, let him have it.
Don't hold back.
Kid barely swung. Oh well, time to ham it up for him.
Ow! Dang Nathan you're strong! We better stop now or else you're going to break my hand.
Haha, sorry. I didn't realize I was so strong.
Well you are! Go ahead and go grab a ball. There's usually one in the bleachers somewhere. Try the other side first.
Sure thing!
He's a sweet kid... are you crying?
Sorry, I just haven't seen that kid smile like that in a long time. It feels good.
I'm trying not to cry. We have some basketball to play and I can't do that with tears in my eyes.
Well said, but I'm happy you're happy.
Now I'll go play with Nathan while you get those eyes dry.
Gotcha, thanks again [mcf].
Great! You found a ball.
Yeah, it's a little big though.
True we can still play with it anyway.
Yeah, I'm growing up quickly so I need to get used to these.
Exactly. That's a good mindset.
My mom says that a lot. That I'm growing up quickly.
Yeah? How's your mom doing? You taking care of her?
What? I'm the child, she takes care of me.
Yeah but you're the man of the house now. That means you have to be strong and be there for your mom. Make sure she's doing okay.
I heard you two have been going through some stuff. It would help out a lot if you were there for her.
It's not hard, you just have to let her know you that you love her and that you're there for her. Can you do that?
Yeah, I can try.
Great, so what do you want to do?
Can you lift me up so I can dunk? My dad used to do it all the time.
Sure thing buddy. You ready?
Yeah!
And up we go!
Wooo!
Ha, Victoria looks a lot like Harp when I dunked on Damien.
That was fun. Let's do it again!
Hold up buddy, we should play some actual basketball before you have to go.
Oh yeah! Let's play!
One short basketball game later
Camera flashes
What the fuck? Who is taking a picture?
Oh, it's that girl from my class. Why is she taking pictures?
Can I help you?
Sorry! I should've told you I was here before I took pictures. I was talking to the nurse and she mentioned you were in here.
I run WVM's website. I'm just getting a photo for a story.
Oh okay, yeah. Next time please ask first.
I will, that was rude of me.
I'm also the girl that will run your social media. Weekly posts about games and how much you love it here at WVM, things like that.
You're going to handle all of that?
Yeah, me and Kimmy will.
Fuck, of course Kimmy would be involved somewhere.
Kimmy? I don't think she likes me very much.
What makes you say that?
Her telling me she doesn't like me.
Why would she say that?
I really don't know. I'd love to find out though.
She's usually a good judge of character. I'll find out what's up.
I'd love to know what you find out.
Mhmmm, I'll let you know. Bye [mcf].
Bye uhh..
Fuck I meant to ask her what her name is.
Oh well...
What was that about?
She was getting a picture for the website, that's all.
Oh well, little man's mom just called and said she's outside.
Awh that stinks.
Don't forget what I told you bud. Be there for your mom, she needs you right now.
Do something nice for her. Make her a card or something just to show that you're thinking about her.
Yes sir. Can we play again some time?
If your mom is cool with it then sure. Maybe some day next week.
It was nice meeting you.
It was nice meeting you too Nathan, don't forget what we talked about.
I won't. Bye [mcf].
Bye Nathan, take care.
I wish he could've stayed for longer.
Me too. But that was nice.
It was and I owe you big time [mcf]. Anything I can do just let me know.
You don't owe me anything Veronica. I'm happy to be here.
You're fucking awesome.
Ha, I try.
I won't take up anymore of your day. I'll see you in class tomorrow okay?
You sure will. Take care Veronica.
You too [mcf], and for the final time... thanks.
Hmm, this went quicker than I thought it would. I could just head home and take my time or I could take that nurse up on her offer to visit.
I doubt I'd consider it on a normal day, but after being interrupted this morning, I just need to do something.
Fuck it, I have to be quick but that nurse was obviously interested in me.
A quick little visit won't hurt anything.
Oh fuck... didn't expect to see pussy right away.
She's well groomed for her age.
Ahem... nurse.
Oh there you are... I started to think you weren't going to come. I've been in that position for so long.
Huh? You knew I was coming?
You really don't think I knew you could hear me in there? Those very crude things I was saying very loudly?
Come on kid, I thought you knew. I tried to get Veronica in on it too.
Now come on, I need to get home soon, my husband will worry about me.
Woah, I don't know now. I didn't know you had a husband, you don't wear a ring.
Oh don't worry about him, he lets me sleep around. He likes to hear about it. It's the only thing that gets him going anymore.
Huh, that sounds a lot like [g1] actually so I can't really judge that, except for that last part.
Take your clothes off.
Fuck it, this is what I came here to do after all.
Mmmm, it looks as good as it did the other day. It's even larger now though.
Nice and erect cock, large as my forearm. You're a keeper kid.
It's a shame I'm not 40 years younger. I'd lock you up.
But that doesn't mean I can't have my fun now.
Lay down...
No, I'm in a hurry too. I want you as you were when I walked in.
Mmmmm, yes sir.
If I didn't know it was her on the other side of this ass, I could never tell it belonged to a 60 year old.
Or maybe I'm just extremely horny, who knows.
She's firm too, she definitely ages well.
Don't be gentle kid, I might be older but I can still fuck like I'm young.
Here we go.
Oh fuck yes... stretch that pussy out.
She's tight, way more so than I would have thought. Maybe all that shit you hear about older women is just exaggerated. This isn't bad at all.
A firm ass, nice legs, swinging tits. There's nothing to complain about.
Deeper, put it deeper.
Oh fuck yes! Fuck me, use my body. Do whatever you want.
Pound my fucking pussy like no one ever has.
Oh fuck...
Just like that! Keep going just like that...
That cock feels so fucking good... the best I've ever had.
Fuck, you're a real surprise.
Oooh fuck, fuck me faster! Deeper!
OOOoooooh! Fuck!
Thaaat's fucking peeeerfect... Fuck meeee..
This is way better than I thought it would be, I'm about to cum...
Just a few more... Oh shit...
Fuuuck.. Damn nurse.
Oh fuck kid, that was... great. Fucking great.
It's all over my back, you're a dirty boy.
You're a dirty girl, so it works out.
Damn right I am, come by anytime when you need to be 'seen'. We could have a lot of fun.
Yeah, maybe. This was fun. I'm going to head out now.
Yeah you should. I need to get home. Hubby will love this story.
And with that, I'm gone.
Fuck, I just hope she keeps this to herself... well just her and her husband I guess.
Time to get home though, need to hurry.
One trip home later
Feels good to be home, I wonder if Harp and Natalie are here.
[mcf]! Behind you.
It appears they are.
Woah Natalie. Is that you?
Haha, yeah. I got a haircut. Do you like it?
It looks great Natalie, your older hairstyle hid those big beautiful eyes.
Hehe, thank you [mcf].
No problem Natalie, I really like your new look.
I like your look too... uhh... you have a nice house.
It's the school's not mine, but thanks Nat.
Uhh, where's your mom at?
She's upstairs with your mom, talking about us as kids and I couldn't take it.
So I came outside to wait on you.
Yeah, I would have ran from that too. Hopefully [am] didn't mention anything too embarrassing about me.
Not really, just a bunch of sweet things. I just couldn't handle my mom's stories.
As much as I'd like to avoid my own stories I should go say hey to them.
Yeah, you should. My mom wanted to talk to you.
Anything serious?
I don't know, probably not. She wouldn't say much.
Well, let's find out.
Man, Natalie's outfit is revealing. I'm surprised Harp let her wear it.
I'm also surprised she's not too shy to put that on. I'm happy she is comfortable enough around me to wear it though.
Before you head inside can we talk for a minute?
Sure Natalie, what's up?
Sit with me for a second.
Are we still on for our... hang out? Or whatever?
Our date you mean?
Hehe, yeah... date.
I'm still down for it. I've been looking forward to it.
Really? I have too...
I have the perfect idea for it as well. Turns out we have a home theatre here. We could watch a movie if you want to.
Just the two of us? That sounds perfect. Is [g1] okay with that?
I heard about you and Shauna... but...
She's more than okay with it, she's happy we're having our date.
I'm happy about it too, so... what kind of date is this?
Like what am I to you?
A friend right now. But I think you're a beautiful girl with a great personality and I can see us being more than that one day.
[mcf], you're going to make me blush. I'm not used to compliments like that.
Are you really interested in me? Like in a relationship way?
You answer first, knowing I'm in a relationship with [g1] and Shauna... would you want to be a part of that?
I'm new to all this... I'm not sure what I'd want. It does seem comforting knowing they'd be there for you if there was something I couldn't do...
Well, I'm interested in you Natalie but you'd have to be completely okay with me being with the other girls.
You obviously don't have to decide anything now. We can just be friends and see how things progress.
I'd like that... I just don't want to agree to something I'm not certain of...
I understand. It's not the normal relationship and if you're not okay with that then that's completely fine.
I'm going to go say hey to our moms.
You sure you don't want to sit here for a little longer?
I'd love to, but I really should let them know I'm here.
Yeah... okay. I'll be out here.
I'll be back soon.
I'll be out here. I don't want to hear her embarass me.
Haha, fair enough. I'll be back out here shortly.
There's Harp, but she's alone.
She's also drinking wine. Ha... never seen one of my coaches drink any alcohol before... surprisingly.
Harp, how's it going?
Oh, there you are. Shauna told us that you were going to meet Veronica's nephew. How did that go?
He's a sweet kid. It was a good time and I think he had fun.
I've met him once and he seemed like a good kid. That was really nice of you.
Thanks Harp, I plan to meet him again soon. So... you met my mom?
Yep and everything is starting to make sense. She seems like a lovely lady.
She's great. I love her to death.
That's sweet. She seemed to love you just as much. I feel like I know a lot more about you after talking to her.
Ha, what did she tell you?
Just some stories from your childhood. Some of the things you've done for her. She told me about you and Shauna growing up and some of the things you two have been through.
But that leads me to what I need to talk to you about and I'm sorry but I need to get serious for a moment.
I understand Harper. What do we need to talk about?
You know I'm a mom right?
Of course Harp.
Well that comes first, way before my job as your coach.
I have no problem with how you choose your relationships, that is entirely up to you and is your personal business.
As long as you show up to practice and give the team all you can give it. You're free to do whatever in your own time.
But when my daughter is involved that is entirely different. I haven't been the best mom...
I was too strict on her growing up. She didn't have a father for the large portion of her life and I've always felt the need to be that for her.
I didn't let her have a social life and I blame myself for that. She's very inexperienced...
But she seems to be very infatuated with you and I think that's great. I think you're a great guy.
Not just great, you're special and I'd let you date my daughter without a second thought...
If it was just her... I'm not sure how I feel about the whole open relationship thing.
I don't want my daughter to hate me though. I also don't want my protectiveness to hold her back anymore.
So I'm going to leave that up to her.
I need you to promise me that you'll take care of her and honor whatever she decides.
She's such a wonderful girl with such a big heart and I don't want to see her hurt.
I like you [mcf]... I can't thank you enough for what you've done for me and Natalie already.
But if you hurt my daughter then... things will be different.
Just... please promise me [mcf]... You'll take care of my daughter.
Harp, I agree with you. Your daughter is a wonderful girl with a big heart.
I like making her smile and I like that she's opening up to me quickly, it's endearing.
Me and Natalie are just friends... for now.
We actually talked before I came in here... about a few things.
One of those being my current relationship with [g1] and Shauna. I told her that I'm interested in her.
But I'd still be with the other girls, we both agreed we would continue as friends and see where things go.
I love having you and Natalie around and I love how quickly me and you are growing closer.
I also love helping Natalie open up and she's a beautiful girl who I'd be lucky to spend my time with.
I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that. Your daughter is completely safe with me Harp. I promise.
Thank you [mcf]... really.
I knew that's what you would say but it's so nice to hear you actually say it instead of assume you would.
I'm sorry for being the overprotective mom... twice today.
It's fine Harp, you're a great mom. Me and Natalie are going to have our date just as friends.
We have a home theatre in the basement and me and her are just going to watch a movie. You're free to stay and monitor us if it makes you feel more comfortable.
As much as I want to say yes to that... I trust you.
I'm glad to hear that Harp. Is there anything else we need to talk about?
No, I think that's it. For now at least.
It's nothing too serious, I just hate that I feel the need to talk about this.
What's up Harp?
It's just about what I saw in the gym today, or I should say what everyone saw in the gym today.
It's none of my business what your personal relationships are like.
But I just want to make sure your head will stay on basketball. I heard a lot of girls talking today.
You're free to do whatever you want to do in your free time.
As long as you show up to practice and give this team everything you've got...
Harp, of course my head is on basketball.
You have no clue how badly I want to get that first win for WVM. Hopefully in our first game.
You have nothing to worry about, my personal life will not conflict in anyway with basketball. I promise.
Thanks [mcf]. I feel stupid for saying it now but I think I needed to hear you say it.
It's fine Harper I don't mind. If you ever need to ask me something to ease your mind well... ask away.
You're too good of a guy [mcf]... I really trust you.
I'm glad to hear that, I trust you too. Is there anything else we need to talk about?
No, I think that's it. For now at least.
[mcf]! You're home!
Hey mom, how was your day?
Boring... I missed you.
I missed you too. What did you do today?
Straightened up a bit and some other things. Just trying to keep myself busy...
I'm not used to having this much free time. I feel guilty just sitting here all day.
Don't feel guilty, you worked your butt off for so many years to take care of me. This is only the start of paying that back.
I love you... I don't need anything but to be surrounded by my family.
We're not going anywhere... and I love you too mom.
We do need to work on getting you out of the house some though.
I'm fine, you know I've always liked staying at home.
I also know you don't like being alone though. We should find you a friend that you can hang out with while we have to be at school.
We'll worry about that some other time dear... your coach is a very lovely woman.
Yeah, I think so too. She's been really great with me so far.
Good, she said she liked the pool... you should invite her to take a swim. Relax a bit while I cook.
You sure? I can help you cook if you need me too.
No sweety, it's fine. I haven't done much today and don't mind cooking... you relax.
Okay, thank you. If you need anything just let me know.
So, do you want to go for a swim Harp?
Uhh, yeah... I didn't bring a bathing suit though.
We have plenty here that have never been touched.
Okay then, sure. Let's go for a swim. That sounds nice.
Perfect, I'm going to go get changed into one too and I'll meet you and Natalie out there.
Sounds like a plan. I haven't been in a pool for well... way too long. I'm excited.
Haha, well I'm glad. Better get changed quickly then.
A few minutes later
Looks like I'm the first one out here. I'm happy we're going for a swim, I'm a little wound up.
I still have a lot to do today... I should swing by the diner and see all those girls.
I also have the whole thing with Rachael planned. I still have no clue who the second girl is and that's exciting.
Then there's the second threesome with Keyana... She hasn't called or texted me or anything yet though.
Maybe her wife had second thoughts... hopefully not.
I still need to visit Zoe and see what happened between her and Emiko.
Then the arcade with Shauna. I need to go all out and make this a very memorable first date for her.
I also get to have some time alone with [g1]. While I have no issues spending time with both of the girls, I'm happy I have this time to solidify things with them individually.
I know [g1] probably just plans on chilling here... but I want to do something nice with her too. Maybe there's a romantic spot around here.
You a robot?
I've been standing here for a minute waiting for you to move. Everything okay?
Haha, yeah I'm good. Just deep in thought.
Harp really pulls off that bathing suit...
Where's Natalie?
Well there's a slight issue. All of those bathing suits were really revealing.
She's too shy to come out here in it...
I told her I'd come out here and distract you while she snuck in and hid in the water.
But I trust that you understand that and will look away and let her be comfortable.
Of course Harp. Let's go ahead and jump in the pool and I'll look the other way.
Thank you [mcf].
Yesterday Harp was saying she was self conscious about her body... she doesn't seem that way right now.
There's no reason for her to be anyway, she looks great.
I guess she might be having post workout confidence from our jog this morning also.
Perfect, we'll just stay like this until Natalie gets in.
Works for me.
I don't have any issues with this view right here anyway.
So... how's life?
Honestly Harp, a bit crazy these past few days.
I can imagine... are things calming down at least?
I don't know, every day there has been something new. As soon as one thing settles another emerges.
I know the feeling [mcf], you know I'm here for you if you ever need to talk right?
Of course I do Harp. You're my coach but I've never really went swimming with a coach before, so you're more than that.
I've never spent time with one of my players outside of the gym. So I guess we're both in uncharted water.
Ha, say... what made you want to become a coach anyway?
Huh? Oh uh...
There's Natalie... don't look she's about to get in.
That was strange... Seemed like a simple question.
Hmm, that suit does seem revealing. Props to Natalie for coming out in it despite being shy.
What are you two chatting about?
Life... and saying we're here for eachother. That goes for you too Natalie.
Awh, that's sweet. I'm here for you too [mcf].
And of course I'll always be there for my daughter.
Haha, Natalie looks like she doesn't want Harp to act this way when I'm around... but I find it cute.
It just give me a warm feeling... I wish I knew more about their past though.
You girls are cute.
AAAAH!!! Oh my god!
What was that? Is she okay?
That sounded bad...
No, that wasn't a bad scream. She sounded excited. I'm going to go check on her.
How can you tell it wasn't bad? That just sounded like a scream to me.
Ehh, I just know [am] I really should check just in case though. I'll be right back.
We'll be out here...
Woah, Rachael is here earlier than I thought she would be. Well there's mom's friend to hang out with.
I'm happy she's here, I'm sure there's aspects of their friendship that me and the girls aren't able to provide.
What are you doing here Rachael!?
I'm here to take you back obviously!
Aha, I'm going to have to object to that.
What are you gonna do? Stop me?
That's exactly what I'd do.
Haha, I'm just teasing. I couldn't make [am] come with me no matter what I tried anyway.
Did you know she was here [mcf]?
Yeah, we saw each other at a bus station this morning. I told her to come over and see you anytime.
I got here as soon as I could. I was busy with meetings and setting up something.
Why are you in swimming trunks [mcf]?
Well... I was swimming. Would you like to join us?
That sounds like a lovely idea.
You know I really wouldn't mind a swim right now. Sure, got any extra suits?
We should... probably. Not really sure how many there were to start.
Well won't you be a gentleman and show me to them?
I don't think he needs to help you find a bathing suit Rach...
Well I certainly don't know where they are at. I just need the boy to show me where they are. You don't mind do you [mcf]?
No I don't mind, I can show you where we keep them.
Mom really doesn't trust me alone with Rachael, I guess she does have good reason not to.
Perfect, lead the way.
Be back soon mom.
This is a nice place [mcf].
Thank you, all the bathing suits should be in the room behind you.
What's the rush? We have a lot to talk about.
I assume we do, but in the hallway probably isn't the best place to talk.
Then come in the room and talk to me while I change.
Yeah? I guess we could do that.
Ooooh, I expected a bit of fight from you. This is a nice surprise, come on then.
No funny business though. We're saving that for later.
When exactly?
I'll let you know as soon as I do.
Still not going to tell me anything about the other girl?
Nope, you'll like her though. She's a big time client.
Okay, I'm excited... very much so.
Imagine me kid, I've been in meetings all day just thinking about it.
I'm surprised at my self control to not jump your bones now.
Awh, you wore panties today. I was hoping for a repeat of last time.
You think I go commando all the time?
I can dream can't I?
Haha, that was a very rare thing. I knew you were coming and I wanted to impress. Since you remember it I assume I did?
That's a pretty safe assumption.
Hmmm, what about these?
Jesus Rachael, they're exactly as I remembered them. So yeah, very memorable.
Good, good.
They're a little sore today, if only there was a big strong man to help me massage them...
You're going to tease me too?
Hehe, I guess I am.
Okay, you should wait in the hall now, I'm not as groomed as I'd liked to be and don't want you to see that yet.
Ha, fair enough... I'll be in the hall then.
Huh... weren't me and her supposed to talk about something?
We do? Well you should get changed and then we'll talk okay?
Hmmm... sure. Be out in a moment.
Take your time.
I wonder what we need to talk about?
I know I still need to ask her about my biological mom. Probably shouldn't do that when [am] is around though.
I wonder how [g1] and Liz are getting along. I wish Shauna or Stacy could have went with them to help smooth any bumps that may happen.
Looking back on it I should have told them to put it off for a bit and then we would all go once I was done meeting Veronica's nephew.
Maybe I'm just worrying over nothing and they're having a great time...
What do you think?
Oh. Uhm... It's uhh...
It leaves you speechless huh?
You uhh, yep.
Haha, that's cute. So? Where's the pool?
Don't we need to talk first?
Yeah, we should. I was thinking about waiting until after dinner to bring it up... let's talk outside.
I want it to be a surprise, so I don't want [am] to hear somehow.
Sure, we'll take the long way to the pool and just chill halfway and talk about whatever.
So? What is this secretive thing?
You're not going to tell [am] right?
Not unless it's something that can harm her.
Good answer. Uhh... I might be around for a bit.
That's awesome Rachael. What happened?
Those meetings and all that, well they weren't actually meetings. I just purchased a new office space here.
That's great. So you're expanding the business?
Expanding one and closing another. I sold my old company and I'm focusing on my whole fixer business.
You have caused quite the stir. I have a backlog of like 15 women already who are all ready to pay. I even upped the price.
I could make a ton just off of you alone. So being close to you and having a place for you to meet the women sounds like a good plan.
Does that mean my pay changes at all?
Heh, yes it will. You'll be paid as soon as there's confirmation the girls are pregnant.
You should come by and see it today and we can talk about a few more things.
I think I know what she means by that.
Sure Rachael. I'll swing by.
Great! I'll send the address. So... anything happen between you and [am]?
Do you mean that how I think you mean that?
Yes.
Then no, we haven't.
[mcf]... why not?
Because she's my mom. Why do you want us to so badly?
Is it not obvious? That beautiful woman is totally in love with you. No woman talks about anyone the way she talks about you.
What part of that makes you think we should do anything together? She's a great mom and I'm a good son. That's it.
She doesn't have to be your mom anymore. You could make her an actual mom.
Jesus Rachael, there's a thing called boundaries you know?
Come on, I know it's strange but hear me out.
You view her as a soft and innocent woman right?
Yes I do.
You would do anything for her and you want to see her as happy as she possibly could be right?
Of course.
Do you think she's ugly?
I think she's beautiful. That's not the point though.
That's exactly the point. You're not related, you love her and everything she has to offer. So I repeat... why not?
It's not that simple Rachael.
Why isn't it? Here... just close your eyes.
Rach...
Please [mcf]...
Thank you, now don't freak out or flip. Just think about [am]. Not as your mom but as a woman. Imagine her in something sexy crawling towards you.
Just think about all the things she's never done that she'd be willing to do with you.
She's slowly inching towards you...
You can't resist her, the woman who raised you is now just putty in your hand. Your play thing to please.
Imagine pinning her down...
She's not even resisting, she knows she wants it.
She's yours to take. So are you really telling me you aren't interested in that?
Open your eyes.
So? What do you say?
Uhhh....
[mcf]!
Oh thank god... I needed someone to rescue me from this moment.
Over here!
Heh, it's cute she's still trying to hide behind the wall. Not doing the best of jobs though.
I went searching for you. Where did you go?
My mom had a friend show up. She's going to join us and swim a bit.
Hi, it's nice to meet you my name is Rachael.
Oh... it's nice to meet you as well. I'm Natalie.
I'm uhh... going to go back to the pool.
Okay Natalie, we'll be back there in a minute.
I don't think she liked that. Probably just her being shy around new people.
Damn, look at the ass on her. Is that the girlfriend I heard so much about?
No, she's my coach's daughter.
Oooh, better stay away from her.
But there's my girl.
Huh?
Hey babe, I missed you.
I missed you too, where's Elizabeth?
Right behind me, things got a little tense so I'm giving her some space.
Oh no, what happened?
Nothing really. I could just tell she was getting frustrated. I don't think she likes her hair right now.
I tried to tell her it was fine but... you know. We aren't there yet.
I'm proud of you two, that's a great start.
Are you going to introduce me [mcf]?
Rachael this is [g1]... my girlfriend.
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard quite a few stories about you. All of them were good.
Keep being you kid.
Oh... Thank you very much. I will.
I'll get out of your hair. There's a pool calling me.
We're not far behind.
Rachael? That was [am]'s boss right?
Mhmmm, she might be around a bit. She moved to an office here.
That's good for [am] right? She has one of her friends back. I'm happy for her.
I am too, Rachael can be a handful but she means well.
Oh! I just remembered.
So you did get them painted. They look great.
Hehe, thank you baby.
I like it a lot. Way better than the half painted nails I had before.
Ha, I'm sure.
So how did meeting Veronica's nephew go?
Really well. He was a sweet kid and he was going through some things. Made me feel awful.
Like what?
His dad is in jail and he doesn't even know it. Things like that.
That is awful. Did you make him have a good time?
It seemed like it. We didn't get to hang out for long so I told him I'd meet up with him again.
Something about kids, I can't stand seeing them go through something like that.
You're going to make a great father one day [mcf].
Mwah!
How is Shauna?
I haven't seen her. She should be sleeping.
Are you excited for your date with her?
Of course I am, I'm excited for ours too.
Are you going to try anything with her?
Depends, we said we'd take things slowly so I'm going to follow her lead on that. I have something in mind though.
I want to hear all about how it goes.
Whatever you do decide to do, save some energy for me. I have something planned for tonight myself.
Oooh, I can't wait to find out.
Don't worry, you will. Is Natalie here?
Yeah she's in the pool.
I'm going to go say hey to her. Are you coming?
Uhh, in a minute. I'm going to see how Elizabeth is doing. Then I'll be there.
She's acting a little strange right now, just a fair warning. But it's sweet of you to be thinking about her.
Thanks for the heads up, I'm just going to make sure she's doing okay then I'll be back there.
No rush, she might need you. I'm not sure. If you need me at all let me know.
I will babe.
There she is, she definitely seems to be down.
Her hair isn't bad... not how it was but not bad.
Liz? Are you okay?
Huh?
Oh, hey [mcf].
What happened Liz?
I don't think I can do it...
What? Your hair looks nice to me.
No... the hair stinks. But it's just hair. I don't know if I can pull off fixing things with [g1].
I tried I really did. I just felt myself getting angrier and angrier for no reason. I think I ruined it.
She even walked ahead of me, she didn't want to be around me anymore...
Liz, that's not true. I just talked to her.
She said she could tell you were getting irritated so she gave you some space.
It has nothing to do with her not wanting to be around you. She's just trying her best to make it work and she can tell you're trying too.
You've done great today Liz. I'm proud of you.
Really?
Absolutely. I'm so happy to see you two interact. Today was a good step in the right direction. You did good.
Mwah!
Elizabeth, we shouldn't do that.
What? It's just a friendly peck. You've been everything I've needed you to be today. You deserve a little kiss.
Okay... we're all by the pool if you want to join us.
I think I'm going to rest a bit [mcf], on my own...
That's fine, I won't push anything today. Get some rest.
Thanks [mcf], for everything... again.
You've been everything I've needed you to be today [mcf]. Thank you...
It's what family does for family... we're all by the pool if you want to join us.
I think I'm going to rest a bit [mcf], on my own...
That's fine, I won't push anything today. Get some rest.
Thanks [mcf], for everything... again.
Hmmm, Rachael isn't out here? She must've went back inside with [am].
Natalie has that same kind and innocent look with [g1]. They do seem to be growing quickly as friends.
Girls, I am back.
Welcome back. I think you're about to be leaving again though.
Why's that?
There's a picnic table in the back. I was about to go check it out and see if it's good for us all to eat on.
Well then it does look like I'm leaving again. Sorry Natalie.
Ha you're good... the pool is my friend today. Plus I'll be there when the food is ready.
Fair points. Have fun Natalie.
Oh [g1], you should've let me test it first. So I could make sure it was stable before you sat down.
It could have split or cracked and you could've gotten hurt.
Hmmm, are you just trying to protect my butt from damage?
Ha, I mean no... but yes.
I think it's a perfectly fine table... sit with me.
I like looking at you...
Haha, that's random. I like looking at you too though. Those big brown eyes, cute little nose, your perpetual smile, and don't get me started on the freckles.
You always know exactly how to put butterflies in my stomach, time and time again no matter what.
I mean it, I wouldn't mind if life could just be what we are doing right now.
Sitting with the best girlfriend in the world, staring into her eyes. Knowing all of our family and loved ones are nearby.
It is nice. I wouldn't mind it either. In fact I wish that was reality... that we could just sit here forever with a slight breeze on us. It would be heaven.
But about the family and loved ones...
What about it?
Do you think we'll be adding any more girls to that soon?
Uhhh, actually yes. One. I offered Stacy to stay with us indefinitely. I might have pushed her into it a bit.
Are you and Stacy?
No, she just did an insanely nice thing for me and I'm trying to pay her back for it. Plus it's nice having her around.
I can't get over just how thoughtful you are. You always put others above your own needs.
Not always, I try my best though.
Hehe, my hand is so tiny compared to yours...
You don't mind that I asked her? I know I should have made sure it was okay with you and Shauna first, [am] as well but it was very much an in the moment thing.
I understand. I'm happy she'll be here too. I would've liked to have been asked but my answer would have been yes anyway.
I promise I'll ask no matter what in the future.
Thank you baby.
Food is coming!
One chicken salad for the lovely couple.
But that's... that isn't what I asked for, I mean technically it is but...
Haha, oh well, it was still very nice of [am] to cook so much food on such short notice.
Thanks so much for the food mom.
Of course honey, I hope you like it.
Everyone here?
Are you going to wake up Shauna?
No she should get her rest, I'll buy her some food tonight at the arcade or after.
So if everyone is here then... let's eat.
One chicken/salad meal later
Thanks for having us over... I think I'm going to head home now.
You don't have to go just yet.
I know, I've been up for a long time though and we both have to get up early so I would like to rest a bit.
I understand Harp.
Take good care of my daughter [mcf]...
She's completely safe Harp, I'll have her home soon.
There's no rush, have a good time... just not too late.
Yes ma'am. I'll see you bright and early for try outs.
See you then [mcf].
Hey, I'm going to head to my new office myself.
Thanks for coming by, it was a nice surprise for [am].
No problem, you still going to swing by tonight?
Yeah, just message me when there's a good time to come over.
Perfect. I'll do exactly that. See you later.
Bye Rachael.
You ready Natalie? Still down for a movie?
Mhmmm, what movie?
I saw a few cabinets full of movies down there, I'll leave that up to you.
Hmmm, okay. Where's this home theatre?
Follow me.
Dang [mcf], this is nice.
It really is... I didn't even know it was down here until this morning.
If I had this at home I'd probably never leave.
Ha, well you're free to come here anytime and watch as many movies as you want.
You mean that?
As long as you're the same cute, bubbly, and quirky Natalie. Hell yeah.
Oh, one quick compliment and she's right back to her shy self...
Thank you [mcf]...
No problem Natalie... have you decided on a movie?
Yeah I have one in mind. You might like it.
What's it about?
Typical survival movie, it's a girl that was on a crashed helicopter on some island.
Sounds bland I know but I've heard things about it that make me want to watch.
Sounds good to me.
a few minutes later
It's the same woman that was in the movie me and [am] watched the other night.
This seems extremely cheesy though.
I don't know if Natalie is absent mindedly cuddling me or what, but it's nice.
She never really said anything, just slowly drifted into me.
Psst, [mcf].
Oh, what's up mom? Everything good?
Yes honey, I was just checking to see if you two needed anything. Any drinks or blankets or whatever.
Uhh no i think we're good, thanks anyway though mom.
If you change your mind then just yell for me okay?
Will do mom. Thank you.
Hmmm, [am] has never been the kind to interrupt a date so that was strange.
Then again Harp probably just told her to keep an eye on us.
Natalie jumped away from me quick when she realized [am] was in here though.
I'm sorry.
You didn't do anything wrong Natalie. I was enjoying it.
Can I ask you something Natalie?
Sure...
You seem to get a little shy around new people. Yet I don't remember you that shy around me, except for at times.
You're different... my mom talked about you a lot.
I just remember all those days last year where she would come home and just lay in bed.
This same time last year she pretty much cried herself to sleep every night.
Now she's out and about all day, up early with a smile on her face, making breakfast and everything. The difference is insane.
When someone can show up and have that impact on the life of someone you love, you can think the world of that person.
You and your mom seem really close.
She's always had my back, I love my mom.
Heh, this girl trips me up sometimes. One second she has the most distraught look on her face and now she's bright and bubbly again.
Thank you for helping her [mcf].
Of course Natalie. Like I said in the pool, I'm here for you two.
So should we get back to the movie?
Yeah, we're missing quite a bit.
A few minutes later
This movie is wonky. It's got its charm but it's laughable at some parts.
Natalie seems to agree, maybe I'm missing the point of it.
The rest of the movie later
That wasn't a bad movie... what did you think?
Uhh, yeah it had its moments.
So, is there anything else you'd like to do or should I get you home.
I should be heading home, but first...
You've been very open and honest with me... I want to do the same.
I'm still not sure how I feel about being a part of an open relationship, I need to talk to [g1] some more about it.
But I do know that I like you... a lot.
I like you too Natalie.
And I just wanted to thank you with a little...
Mwah!
This girl is beyond cute. This kiss reminds me of mine and [g1]'s first kiss. It's like I'm reliving it.
That wasn't bad was it?
Not in a single way. It was great.
You're a special girl Natalie. I'm happy you're here.
I hope we can do this again soon.
I definitely wouldn't be opposed to it.
Then we'll set something up soon. Should I take you home now?
Yes please.
Okay, let me go say bye to [g1] and then we'll be on our way.
I'll be waiting outside.
Thanks for having us over... I think we're going to head home now.
You two don't have to go just yet.
I know, I've been up for a long time though and we both have to get up early so I would like to rest a bit.
I understand Harp.
Thanks for coming you two.
Thanks for having us.
Have a good rest of your night [mcf]...
Yes ma'am. I'll see you bright and early for try outs.
See you then, bright and early.
Hey, I'm going to head to my new office myself.
Thanks for coming by, it was a nice surprise for [am].
No problem, you still going to swing by tonight?
Yeah, just message me when there's a good time to come over.
Why don't you come by now?
Uhh, I mean I guess I could do that.
I'm going to go tell [g1] bye before I leave. I think she went up to one of the rooms.
Take your time. I'll meet you there.
Dang, is she sleeping? At least I got a good view of her legs before heading out.
I'm tempted to see if she's really asleep but she should get her rest. I want her to be ready for tonight.
Plus I still have everything with Rachael to get 
Babe... are you asleep?
Huh?
Oh hey baby. How'd everything go?
Very well. I was just coming up here to tell you I'm about to head out.
Oh, are you going to the arcade now?
Not yet, there's some things I have to get done first then I am.
Oh... how long will you be out?
Not sure. What I do know is I came up here and got to see that you weren't wearing any underwear under that skirt.
Are you sure about that?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure about it.
Prove it then.
Oooh, you asked for it.
Baby, baby, I was joking!
Haha, it's too late for that now.
Caught with your panties down.
Hehe, you got me.
You're so fucking sexy [g1].
Oh babe...
I can't resist...
No one says you have to...
OHHH! Babe! No teasing today huh? Just straight to it.
Is that an issue?
Not at fucking all.
Take your shirt off.
Yes sir...
Mhmmm, good girl.
Oh fuck...
How does it feel?
Fucking incredible... I don't know what you're doing with that finger... but keep doing it...
Mmmmmmmm....
Faster baby...
Oh... fuck yeah... Mmmmmm...
I'm already getting that feeling...
Don't hold back... Let it all out.
Mmmm keep going like this... mmmmmm... and I will...
Just a little bit more...
I'm about to... fuck baby...
I'm right there... Keep going!
Huh? [mcf]? Why did you stop?
Sorry [g1]. I want you as worked up for tonight as I am.
Baby, come back!
Think about it [g1], we're both worked up to our limit. Tonight is going to be fun.
Mwah!
That's all I wanted. A goodbye kiss.
You're not upset?
Slightly annoyed but I know what you're doing and I... like it.
What do you mean?
I like doing what you say... At least when we're fooling around that is.
Oh really? You know what you should do then?
What do you have in mind?
Nothing much, I just want a good view of your ass before I leave. Something to think about while I'm out.
Anything for you.
It will be here anxiously waiting for tonight.
I fucking love you babe.
I love you too baby, have a good time out
You ready to go?
Define ready? But yes I am. Are we walking?
No, we'll take my car. Let me get it real quick. Just stay here and I'll pull up.
Get in loser we're going shopping.
Haha, is this really your car?
Huh, Harper must not have told her about it.
Technically not mine but I get to drive it so it's just as good.
Hop on in.
This isn't dangerous is it?
What? No, we're going to be going the speed limit. Just buckle up and I'll be sure to drive safe.
Okay...
10 minutes later
This was fun...
See it wasn't a scary drive.
Not just that... for everything today. It was fun.
I agree Natalie. Are you going to be at the tryouts in the morning?
I wasn't planning on it but yeah... I think I will go. I'd like to see you then.
You'd definitely make getting up that early not as bad.
Hehe, I'll see you in the morning then [mcf]. Have a safe drive home.
See you Natalie. Have a good night.
Guess now is a good a time as any to head by the diner.
A few minutes later
Guess now is a good a time as any to head by the diner.
A few minutes later
Huh, why is this place empty?
Are they closed?
Certainly looks that way.
Why wasn't the door locked then?
Guess I can lock it for them and head out.
[mcf]! Wait!
Oh, I'm glad to see you Bailey.
What's going on? Is this place closed?
Yes, they close early on Tuesdays.
What are you still doing here?
I live upstairs and I convinced them to let me lock up.
I was waiting for you to come.
Oh god I'm sorry for making you wait Bailey. I didn't realize they closed early.
It's my fault. I forgot to mention it.
Everything happened so fast earlier. My brain has been scrambled since.
What's gotten it so scrambled?
What we did earlier, in that office. It didn't feel real.
It came out of nowhere, I've liked you since I met you on your basement stairs. Which for some reason feels like forever ago.
Is everything you said true?
Yes it is Bailey, I meant it all.
I liked you at first too but I didn't know what to make of you.
Since then you've shown me your kind and caring side.
I like your personality, your style, the way you carry yourself and the fact that you are loyal to those that care about you.
I think you're as cute as could be.
Mwah!
Sit with me for a moment?
Absolutely.
So how exactly will this work? With the other girls I mean.
We'll do our own thing. It'll be just like a normal relationship except you will have to accept the other girls in my life.
Can I tell people about us? I mean I told Rainn but I trust her.
That's up to you. I don't mind at all.
Really? Like, can I talk to you or even kiss you if [g1] or Shauna is around?
That one is iffy. I'm not sure about the kissing but you can absolutely talk to me whenever.
What about in private?
We can do whatever we want in private.
Oh yeah?
So you wouldn't mind me sitting in your lap then would you?
I'm offended it took you this long to do it actually.
Haha shut up... so [mcf].
I'm sorry about earlier in the office. I was a mixed bag of emotions between shocked, shy, and horny.
That's quite the trifecta. How do you feel now?
About the same...
We could go up to your room and fix a few of those emotions you know...
I can't [mcf]... it's a long story. We can't go to my room.
That's fine Bailey. We don't have to do anything. I'm happy with where we are now.
No, no. I want to. It's about Rainn, we had a whole no boys thing. I don't want to hurt her feelings by bringing a guy home.
I don't want to hurt Rainn's feelings either. Here is too in the open, is there anywhere we could?
Oh my god, I'm an idiot. I have an idea.
Follow me.
Are we going to the kitchen?
Yep. We'll be away from all the food and utensils don't worry.
Stay right here. I'll get a little corner set up for us and I'll tell you when to come in okay?
I'll be right here.
Public kitchen sex, that's something new for me...
As long as we're away from everything and clean up after then it really isn't a big deal.
I wonder if Zoe and Emiko live upstairs also.
[mcf]!
Am I good to come in?
Yes!
Damn Bailey... You're so fucking sexy.
I don't have the curves [g1] and Shauna have though...
You don't need those, you're sexy in a whole different way.
Oh, [mcf].
I love this cute petite body of yours.
You really mean that? You're not just saying it?
I mean it Bailey, sit down. Let me show you I mean it.
Getting shy Bailey?
No... A little bit...
It's okay, take your time. Get comfortable.
I'm fine, I just haven't really showed many people my pussy...
I don't know if it's any good...
I'll be happy to be the judge of that.
Hmmm... Okay...
Bailey, it fits you perfectly. You have a sexy innie.
You like it?
I love it. Can I?
Wait, let me slide out a bit.
Okay, I'm ready.
I can't believe this girl is worried about her body. There's something about it that is driving me crazy.
I want to feel inside of her.
Jesus, she's even tighter than [g1] was.
Ohhh, [mcf]... That's... nice.
It doesn't hurt?
No, it feels great.
Hmmm, it doesn't feel that way for me but maybe I'm wrong. I'm worried to risk it though. I should switch it up.
External stimulation is the way to go... for now.
Ohhhhh....
What are you doing? That felt amazing.
Yeah? What about this?
A lick and a rub... see how she reacts to that.
*Muffled moans*
Haha, I didn't expect Bailey to be this... innocent?
It's making her even cuter.
[mcf]... wait. Stand up.
What for?
Please?
It's your turn.
I was just getting started on you. Did you not like it?
It felt amazing [mcf]. I just really want to do this.
Well if that's the case, I won't argue.
Can you back up a little bit so I can get on my knees?
Sure Bailey.
It's so big [mcf]...
I don't know how much I can do to it.
Just do your best. I promise you'll do an amazing job.
Okay, just tell me if I mess up.
Ohhh shit...
Damn Bailey, using both hands and sucking on the very tip. Definitely not that innocent.
Do exactly what you're doing now Bailey but stroke me while you do it.
Mhmmm.. like... this?
Oh shit, yeah... exactly like that.
I was expecting way less from her after how this started but damn.
You're doing fucking great Bailey.
Mmmmm...
Usually I prefer a little faster but I want you to keep going exactly as you are.
I won't last much longer if you keep it up...
Where do you want me to cum Bailey?
Mmmmm-mou...th...
Mmm, good answer. I want to finish with her doing this.
Just a little bit more Bailey, I'm close. 
Holy fuck!
That had to have been a lot and she didn't even flinch...
Did you swallow all of that Bailey?
Mhmmm.
I have no words... That was great.
Go ahead and sit back down and we'll finish what we started before this.
It's okay [mcf], I just wanted for you to finish and have a good time.
You've made me incredibly happy today. I just wanted to thank you.
That's definitely the best 'thank you' I've ever received.
I wouldn't mind getting you off too. Watching you try to muffle your moans was hot Bailey.
Well that's another reason... I was muffling them because I'm scared someone might hear us and find us.
I know this was my idea but I just don't want to risk it and try to do too much.
I understand what you mean. It's not the best look to be found fooling around in a kitchen.
Next time I have you alone though we're going to finish this.
We should be alone again soon then.
Agreed... so should we get dressed?
Yeah we should. You should also walk out first just in case someone is out there... we might not look too suspicious that way.
Smart, I doubt anyone is out there but now is absolutely a good time to play it safe.
A few minutes later
Nope, no one... I need to talk to Bailey about just coming to my house.
[g1] probably wouldn't mind. I don't really know what the rules are for bringing girls home.
I should have Bailey talk to [g1]. [g1] has been pushing me towards Natalie and I'd have to think she might try the same for other girls.
Despite her constant affirmation that this is what she wants... I still can't help but feel like I have to triple check everything.
Hi...
Hi. Everything good?
Yeah, everything is great. Do you want to sit down for a minute?
Sure... I can't stay for very long though.
What? Got some other girlfriends you have to go see?
If you count visiting my mom's boss then yes.
Hehe, I get it. I just wish we had a room to go to right now.
I have an idea for that.
I'm going to talk to [g1] about you coming over one day.
I would love to... I doubt she'd be okay with us going off on our own for a bit though.
I don't know Bailey... I think she'll be fine with it.
I'll let you know how that talk goes tomorrow. Hopefully then we'll have a nice bed to do whatever we want in.
I hope she says yes [mcf]... if she's not okay with me being there we could always rent a room somewhere.
True, I don't think we'll have to though.
I wonder what that story with Rainn is... why is it such a big deal for her to have someone over?
I don't want to ruin the mood by bringing it up now.
I'm just so happy you came. I was about to go upstairs.
I'm happy you waited. This was really nice.
Yes it was.
Are you about to leave?
Not before I get another kiss...
Hmmm... so if I don't kiss you then you'll stay?
Bailey...
Mwah!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes you will. I'll be at practice earlier than usual tomorrow.
Tryouts right?
Yep, Coach needs my help so I'll be there at like 5am. If you're up you should come hang out.
I don't know about that early, but I'll come as soon as I'm up.
Sounds perfect. I'll see you soon Bailey.
See you [mcf]. I'll miss you.
One trip to Rachael's office later
Damn, this place is empty. Rachael's old business had a bunch of flare when you walked in.
I wonder what this place will look like in a few months.
Rachael? You here?
Yeah! I'm back here!
Hey, what's up?
Just getting things ready for tonight.
I'm kind of throwing all of my eggs in this basket. Figure I should just go ahead and sleep here as well.
You're going to sleep here tonight?
Yeah, is there a problem with that?
No, I don't know. I just assumed you'd be staying with us until you got everything going.
Is that an offer?
If you want it to be. I feel bad having to leave [am] home alone all day and it would be nice to have you around to keep her company.
Thank you for the offer. I'll think about it... but we actually need to talk about your living situation.
But first... are you ready to meet the mystery lady?
Of course I am. Is she here?
Not yet but she will be very soon.
You haven't had any surprise threesomes since we've last talked about it have you?
I can't say I have.
Good, let's sit and wait on her then.
So... how did you get into this business anyway?
What? Being a fixer?
Run a successful business for a decade and you'll meet a ton of powerful people.
They all eventually need favors or information. Turns out I enjoy setting all of those things up.
I feel like there could be a ton of problems there... a lot of shady people asking for things.
That's why I only work with those I trust... Sure I can get burned at times but that's why contracts exist.
I don't remember signing any contract.
You will be from here on out. Anna and Keyana were both tests.
I wanted to see how reliable you were. To see if you would disclose any information.
They both knew that risk. They both were heavily discounted for it also.
Oh, damn... I guess I should have realized that.
You're still new to it all... You're learning quickly and you didn't fuck up.
Ha, thanks.
We do need to talk about Keyana though. There were some issues.
Oh? What happened?
Everything we just talked about... the contracts.
Well I did make the girls sign them... but I was told Keyana was the one that wanted your services.
I knew her wife would know so she had to sign a contract as well but it wasn't the one that protects you from her coming after you in the future for child support and all that.
I called Keyana this morning and she told me their plan and I had to shut it down.
Don't worry though, they're coming back to sign new ones.
I don't think she was trying to pull anything on us. I mean why would she tell me about it if she was?
But they're both pissed... but it's business before friends.
Just in the future... if I don't tell you about them, you don't do anything with them. Understood?
Understood Rachael.
That sucks...
It's nice to know Rachael will do what it takes to protect me though.
Now that all that is out of the way... we can relax.
Long day?
Very long day... mainly because I've been looking forward to this.
Hmmm... you know we don't have to wait on her to get started?
[mcf]!
You're an impatient boy...
It's hard to be patient after seeing these splayed out.
You could at least kiss me before playing with my tits.
I wouldn't mind that... didn't know if you would though.
Well I don't. In fact a kiss might just be what it takes to get my top off.
Mwah!
Ha, woman of her word...
I thought that would do it. Good boy.
I would've done a whole lot more than that...
I would do a whole lot just to see this cock again.
I've thought about that little stunt you pulled with making me close my eyes every night since we've had sex.
Then you ramming that huge cock in me...
These pants have to go.
Mhmmm... everything feels better now. The world is how it should be.
We should wait until she shows to really start... but I like where your cock is right now.
I've never had a dick between my tits before but that's because I didn't want to embarrass anyone.
I don't think that's an issue for you...
Even still, your cock may be huge but so are my breasts...
Seems like a perfect match to me.
It certainly feels like it... How does it feel to you?
It feels like I want you to keep going.
Mmmmm... I can do that.
Couldn't wait on me?
Oh shit...
That's the actress from the movies I watched with [am] and Natalie
That's the actress from the movie I watched with [am].
There he is. The future dad of my baby.
Fuck, I don't know her name.
Uhh, sorry. We were waiting on you before we got to the actual fun.
It's nice to meet you. You're an actress right?
'An actress'? Yeah, you could say that considering I'm the best paid actress on the planet.
You seriously don't know me? I'm a household name.
I'm sorry I don't watch many movies or keep up with them.
My name is Eden. Me and you have a lot to talk about.
Nice surprise huh? You're being paid to fuck a celebrity. That's got to stroke your ego a bit?
Speaking of stroking, I don't see much action happening.
Well now that you're here we can do something more inclusive.
I got to say I wasn't looking forward to the small talk before everything.
So I'm happy everything's already going.
He made the first move and I couldn't resist.
Can't say I blame you. He's quite a man.
Yes, yes he is...
Oh wow... I didn't realize how big he was. Your massive tits hid him well.
You ever have two girl's mouths on your dick before [mcf]?
Oh, what am I asking? Look at you... of course you have.
Actually he says he hasn't. I don't know if I believe him though...
Hmmm, well let's show him what it's like.
She's not wasting any time. How does her mouth feel [mcf]?
Feels great... would feel better with you on the other side though.
Don't mind if I do.
That feels amazing girls.
I have a two very successful women on their knees for me right now... and I'm being paid to be here.
Life is good.
Fuck girls... your mouths are great...
Something about two women with their mouths on your cock... there's nothing to complain about.
Mmmmm...
I could let this go on all day... but I want to do more with them.
Okay girls, let's do something else.
Phew, I have on way too many clothes for this.
I think both of you girls do.
You have such nice tits Eden.
My tits? Look at yours...
They're so big and soft... you should be the one getting pregnant.
I'd love to see these puppies full of milk.
Woah, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We're here to get you pregnant not me.
And I think we both have on some clothes that prevent that from happening.
Let's take them off then, I wonder which pussy he would prefer... mine or yours.
Only one way to find out. Let's get these clothes off.
Yep, I'm definitely a very lucky man.
So? Which one [mcf]?
You're not hurting any feelings. Tell us the truth.
They're both great but I'd have to pick Rachael.
The little tuft of hair and her thick thighs... no beating them.
Good choice kid.
Hmmm, we'll see if he feels the same way after he's fucked us both.
They're both great but I'd have to pick Eden.
I like innies and her darker skin... but they're both great.
Good choice.
There's tens of thousands of guys that would kill for that pussy so I'm not mad at that.
We'll see if he still feels the same way after he's fucked us both.
Okay, enough talking. Time for action. How do you want us [mcf]?
Are you one of those guys who only wants us to play with him? Or can we play with each other too?
I want you two to lay on top of each other. Pussies stacked so I can fuck you both at the same time.
Oooh, greedy... What do you say Rachael?
Let's give the boy a good time.
Hmmm, I want Rachael on her back and I want you to sit on her face.
Oooh, what do you say Rachael?
Sounds like I'll be fulfilling both of your dreams at once.
Lay down Rachael.
I wonder if she feels as good as I remember.
Stick that cock in me [mcf]. I've wanted it all day long.
Oooh fuck yes...
That's so fucking hot.
How's her tongue Eden?
Fucking amazing, feels even better when she moans. So get to work.
I want to feel her breasts smack against my thighs... fuck her good [mcf].
Give her every inch.
MMMGHMMM....
Oh fuck yes! Make her moan into my pussy!
Make those big juicy tits bounce up and down.
Oh... shit...
MMMMMMMmmmm...
This is so fucking hot!
I want to play with the both of you every day for the rest of eternity.
How does she feel?
Fucking great.
Mmmm... I wonder how she tastes.
Suck my cock and find out.
Mmmm... naughty boy.
Don't mind if I do.
Holy shit...
How does she taste?
Mmmm... perfect.
Turn around Eden and lay on Rachael's stomach. I want to fuck you both at the same time.
Mmmmmm...
Hehe, how does his cock feel Rachael?
You're about to find out.
First you'll think 'Holy shit there's no way it's going to fit'.
Then you'll feel it stretch you apart... it feels amazing.
You'll reach a point where you don't think he'll go any deeper... then...
Boom!
Holy shit!!!
Holy shit is right...
Haha, how does it feel?
So fucking.... agh....
Hold it, that tingly feeling goes away... until he starts going again anyway.
Fuck us [mcf].
Holy shit! He's so fucking big!
It doesn't get easier... every thrust will send that shock through you.
You girls feel fucking amazing.
You like fucking our tight pussies? Mmmm...
Holy shit...
I'm getting close girls...
Don't forget to finish in Eden... Give her all of it.
Fill me up [mcf]!
FUCK!!! HNNGGHH!! FUCK ME!
Ohhh fuck yes... fuck her real good [mcf]...
Aghhh, holy fuck!
Can you feel it? Did he fill you up?
His cock is spasming inside of me... I think he did.
Mmmm... good.
I can feel it leaking out of me.
I feel it running down me too.
Shit Rachael, why were you hiding this guy from me?
I'm not hiding anyone, he's still new to this.
So now that he's finished...
What did you need to talk to him about?
Oh, that's right.
First, thank you for this [mcf]. That was great.
Yeah, it was.
Going back to only one girl will be tough.
I have something to ask you [mcf].
Ask away.
We're both famous right?
Well I mean... you are.
You are too. Like it or not.
Anyway, what if we did something crazy? Get both of our names talked about in every home in the world.
What do you have in mind?
A sex tape. Just me and you... you'll record it and it will 'leak'.
Eden... that's a pretty big deal. That will be out there forever.
Good, come on. I'm hot but I'm not getting any hotter. I have a movie coming out soon and this would be the icing on the cake.
Every guy would wish they were you. Every girl would wish they were me. Both of our names would be on every headline for weeks.
Of course we'd end it with you finishing in me again. It's a win-win for us both.
What do you think Rachael?
It's your life, if you want to do it then do it.
Just remember everybody will see it. Including everyone you don't want to see it.
[am] especially. That girlfriend of yours too.
Although I heard she might be more open to something like that. It's a lot to consider.
What do you say [mcf]?
Fuck it, let's do it.
My face can't be in the video though. We can hint that it's me in the video but no confirmation.
Deal!
Thank you [mcf]. We'll set a date real soon okay?
Sounds good Eden.
Today has been fucking awesome. I'm going to go get cleaned up.
Don't go anywhere.
Everyone is already talking about my relationship. Why not give them a sex tape to talk about as well?
I'm sorry Eden but I don't really want a sex tape attached to my name.
Oh... that's dissapointing...
Well... I guess I'm going to go clean myself up.
I feel kind of bad turning her down but that's too far for me.
That sounds weird coming from the guy impregnating strangers but I wouldn't do this if it were public.
That was fun...
Yes it was.
We still have some things to talk about... want to get dressed?
Yeah, we should.
Threesomes are great.
I still have my dates with [g1] and Shauna. Tonight should be fun as well.
Okay, now that we're decent. I want to talk to you about something.
And I'm just going to be blunt in saying it.
So... you have a big problem coming up and you're playing right into it.
Ha, what a completely vague and worrying thing to say.
I'm being serious. I know about the two houses and the nice car.
I know, they're awesome right?
But those things make you dependant on that Charles guy. I heard most of your conversation with him in the bus station.
He's a time bomb. He'll be on your side until the second he thinks he can get more from someone else.
And if that never happens then he will end up having a power trip and be nothing but a headache for you.
I've had to deal with men like him all of my life, they're no good.
I've spent the last few days combing every available property around here to find this office.
I can have you in a new home by tomorrow. Just say the word.
Hmmmm... she makes some great points. Charles has given me no reason to trust him. Not to mention his nephew knows where I live.
Hell, he might even have a key to the house...
So instead of being dependant on Charles... I'd be dependant on you?
You're learning... good.
Nothing in life is free. You'd have to continue working for me.
But now that the word is out about you... there's a ton of women wanting to sign up.
Supply and demand... prices are going up so I can take care of the house.
I have so many women in line for you.
Rachael... if I continue doing this I'm going to have to tell my girlfriend about it.
Oooh, if you do that then she's going to have to sign a contract as well.
You really shouldn't tell her about the ones you've already done. She might flip and blow the lid on this thing.
Just tell her it's a new offer. I'm coming over later and we can both discuss it with her.
Yeah? That works with me.
Perfect. Then we're all straight.
What about it?
Let me sit down first. It's been a long day.
So... you have a big problem coming up and you're playing right into it.
Ha, what a completely vague and worrying thing to say.
I'm being serious. I know about the two houses and the nice car.
I know, they're awesome right?
But those things make you dependant on that Charles guy. I heard most of your conversation with him in the bus station.
He's a time bomb. He'll be on your side until the second he thinks he can get more from someone else.

Hmmmm... she makes some great points. Charles has given me no reason to trust him. Not to mention his nephew knows where I live.
Hell, he might even have a key to the house...
So instead of being dependant on Charles... I'd be dependant on you?
You're learning... good.
There's no such thing as free. You would have to work for me.
Do you mean the whole pregnancy thing?
Not exactly... although that would be ideal.
There are other things you could do for me. None of them come near the money we could make doing the original plan though.
Speaking of, I spread it around that a very high profile athlete might be interested in something like that.
My phones been going off with the amount of women inquiring about it.
[am] also told me about your girlfriend's new deal. So there's nothing holding you back.
There's a big difference between seeing other girls and impregnating strangers.
The only difference is your mindset.
[g1] might feel differently about that.
Well then, don't say no now. Go home and have a talk with her... be honest about it and if she has any questions I'll be there later tonight and she can ask me.
Okay... I can do that at least.
Great, I'm happy to hear that. So are we in agreement about getting you into a new house where no one has leverage on you?
You mean no one besides you?
I'm no threat to you. I see how valuable you are and you're also the son of the woman I'd kill for.
Hold on, let's say [g1] isn't okay with it or I decide I'm not okay with it. What would the other job be?
Ooooh. That's not as glamorous. It would start with you helping move a lot of furniture into this place.
After that would just be whatever I needed help with. I might need you as security one day or you might could help with the business.
I can't give exacts just yet. But we'll figure something out. What do you say?
I don't really have a choice. I don't want to rely on Charles.
Deal.
Perfect. Then we're all straight.
So... I actually think that's it.
Actually Rachael... what about my mom?
Oh my god I almost forgot.
I left your mom many messages before she got back in touch with me.
When I told her you were trying to find her she got very emotional...
She told me she would have to call me back and that's where we are now.
Thank you Rachael.
I'm sorry I don't have much more yet but I'll let you know as soon as I find out anything else.
You haven't heard anything about siblings have you?
What? Siblings? No, I haven't. Why?
Nothing, just a weird dream I had.
Hmmm, maybe I don't have a sister after all.
If you say so...
Yeah I suppose so.
Thanks for coming today [mcf]. I'll see you later tonight.
See you Rachael.
I should call [g1] really quick and see if she can wake up Shauna for me so she can get ready.
Oh, I have a message from Bailey.
I'm sorry! I forgot to tell you where Emiko and Zoe live. They actually live at the dorms. I don't know why I didn't just say that earlier. lol
Hmm, the dorms. I can swing by there before I pick up Shauna. That way she has plenty of time to get ready.
Time to call [g1].
Hey baby, how's everything going?
Very well... could you do me a favor?
Sure... anything.
Would you mind waking up Shauna for me and telling her to go ahead and get ready for our date?
She's actually already getting ready.
Oh perfect. Uhh, is Stacy there yet?
I don't think so... should she be?
Yeah she should. Huh, I wonder where she is.
You don't think anything bad happened to her do you?
No babe, she said she had to move all of her stuff. She's probably still at her motel.
Can you go by and check on her please?
I was thinking the same thing. I'll head by there before I pick up Shauna.
Text me and tell me if you find her okay?
I will... I love you and I'll see you soon.
I love you too.
Hmm, I think I know where the motel is. I think I've driven by it a couple of times.
A few minutes later
This place looks deserted. Maybe this isn't the motel.
Is there an office for me to check?
Yes there is... and that looks like Jasmine in there.
[mcf]??? What are you doing here?
I could ask you the same thing.
Kimmy works here. I've been hanging out with her.
Fuck Kimmy is here, I'd rather avoid her right now.
So what about you?
Uhh, have you seen Stacy?
She's the redhead with freckles right?
Yeah that's her.
Uhhh... last I saw her she was talking to Ryker.
Ryker? As in my teammate?
Yeah. But last I heard you knocked him out.
Wait... Ryker is Charles' nephew? Fuck...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Jasmine what room is Stacy in?
If that fucker touched her...
Third door on the left, first floor.
What's wrong [mcf]?
If he laid a finger on her I'll fucking kill him...
Her lights aren't on... that can't be good.
KNOCK, KNOCK
STACY! Open the door!
...
STACY!!!
...
Ryker she better be okay...
STACY!!!!! Open the door!!!
Lightswitch flickers
Huh? I just heard someone inside.
Stacy!
I'm sorry [mcf]! I didn't mean to fall asleep.
Oh my god... Stacy.
Fuck me, I have to calm down. I probably scared Stacy to death.
I was ready to kill someone...
I'm sorry for scaring you... Jasmine told me Ryker was with you. I didn't know if he would try something.
I don't trust that creep.
Oh, she's hugging me tighter.
He was here... but Kimmy made him leave.
I need to thank Kimmy then. Do you have all your stuff ready to go?
I just need to pack a few last minute things.
You do that then I'll take you home okay?
What the hell is going on out here!?
Oh, Kimmy. I'm sorry for the noise.
I'm sorry [mcf]... I didn't know Kimmy made him leave already.
It's okay Jasmine. I heard Ryker was here and I was worried if Stacy was safe or not.
Well she is because I kicked that creep out of here. Kind of like how I'm doing with you now.
I'll leave very soon Kimmy. I'm just waiting on Stacy to get her final things.
Thank you for helping her... I owe you.
You can pay me back by leaving.
I don't think she likes you very much.
Ha, I wonder what makes you think that? She didn't happen to tell you why she hates me did she?
Kind of... it didn't make a ton of sense to me though.
Can you tell me?
Yeah, can I sit down first?
Sure.
Okay, first things first. Kimmy mentioned she had to run your social media...
I decided I'd help her out by taking care of that so here you go.
I need a new phone just for social media?
Yes... it also has the contacts of everyone important at WVM.
There's quite a few posts for you already... we ran a little ticket giveaway where fans had to post some selfies.
You don't have to check it out now... just sometime tonight okay?
Sure Jasmine...
Why did Kimmy have to run my social media in the first place?
Do you know what Kimmy was before you came here?
No, I don't.
She was you... the star on the campus.
Except she was the star for swimming. She got the house, the car, all that stuff.
Now that you're here she's had to move into the dorms and give her car back... to pay for everything now she's had to pick up some jobs.
One here and two for you.
Two?
She's also your maid.
Fuck, she doesn't have to do that.
I didn't know any of that Jasmine, no wonder she hates me.
I get her being upset but she can't blame you.
I understand it. I'd be upset at the person that made my life harder too.
You're a good guy [mcf]... but you can't always worry about how other people feel.
You didn't choose for those things to be taken from her... it's not your fault.
She'll realize that soon. Just give her some time.
Thanks Jasmine.
So how is everything with Damien?
The same... we're meant to talk tonight though.
About what?
Us I guess. He just told me to make some time to talk to him tonight.
Well I hope it goes well.
I do too, it wouldn't be happening if it wasn't for you either.
I didn't do much Jasmine.
Keep telling yourself that.
I should be getting back to Kimmy, she'll be mad that I've been talking to you for this long.
Ha, she probably will be. I'll see you in the morning Jasmine.
I'll see you then [mcf].
It's nice to hear some good news about them for once...
I want Damien and me to be buds. I can't do that if he mistreats my friends though.
I hope he's at tryouts as early as I'll be...
[mcf]?
Oh Stacy. Is that all you're bringing?
Yep this is it.
Do you want me to carry it for you?
I can get it, it's not very heavy...
I really don't mind Stacy.
Ha, be my guest then.
Hey, I really am sorry for freaking out earlier.
It's fine. I'm happy you care enough about me to freak out.
I do... I also should have mentioned that you don't have to live with us if you don't want to. That was a big ask and I sort of forced it on you.
It was a big ask but I'm happy you forced it. I probably would have said no just because.
But you're right. Even though I would never move in with someone I just met... I want to be there.
so even if it's strange... it's what I want so who cares?
I'm glad you feel that way because I definitely want you there... ready to head home then?
I absolutely am.
There is one stop I have to make but it will be quick.
I just want to check in on Emiko and Zoe.
Sure, I don't mind.
Perfect.
A few minutes later
I'll be right back... I'm going to lock the doors just in case.
I'll be fine [mcf]... go check on your friends.
If you feel uncomfortable at all then just call me and I'll come back okay?
Okay, I'll be here.
Knock, knock
Zoe? You're back already?
That was quick...
Get inside before someone sees-
Oh my god! [mcf]! Look away!
What happened to your nose Emiko?
Leave please!
Emiko...
Talk to me... what happened?
...
Did Willow do this?
...
It's okay... you can talk to me.
What happened?
.... You know when you said you would protect me from the mean girls?
Well... when Willow said those things about [g1]. I got angry... I went to talk to Willow about it after class.
She started calling me names too and I got mad and pushed her.
That's when she punched me...
I'm so sorry [mcf].
Emiko... you didn't have to do that.
I just wanted to return the favor. Be the friend to you that you would be for me.
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to get everyone in trouble...
Thank you Emiko.
Why are you thanking me?
Poor girl has bloodshot eyes. I feel awful for her.
Thank you for standing up for [g1] and me. I never want you to do it again... but it really means a lot.
You mean it? But I got everyone in trouble.
You didn't mean to... I'm thankful to have you as a friend Emiko.
Does it hurt?
A little bit... does it look bad?
I could barely notice it until you tried to cover it up.
Will you be in class tomorrow?
I don't know...
I hope you are... you're not afraid of people seeing the bruise are you?
The only person I was afraid of seeing it was you.
Well then there's nothing to worry about because I think you look as cute as ever.
Woah, hey there [mcf].
Oh, hey Zoe.
Having fun?
Sorry, I just came by to check on you two after I heard what happened with Willow.
That's sweet of you.
If I knew you were coming I would have gotten you something to eat too.
I'm good, I've already ate but thank you.
I uhh... I heard you're the one that jumped in and helped Emiko with Willow... I'm glad you were there.
Yeah, me too. Don't get mushy with me. I'm meant to be mad at you.
I missed a day of school, someone has to take the blame and it's not going to be the girl with a bruise on her face.
Fair enough, I'll take the blame.
You can make it up to me though. I'm throwing a party here tomorrow night and it would be awesome if you could come by.
It's nothing big, just a few girls from school.
Uhm sure, can I bring some girls?
Anyone you want. And hey...
Maybe during that party we could sneak off and you could thank me properly.
I'll be at the party Zoe... we'll see about anything else.
Ehh, I like my odds. Are you going to stay for a while?
No, I'll let you two eat. I have Stacy in my car outside.
That's the redhead right?
That's her.
Lucky girl.
Well since you're leaving...
I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning.
You'll be at tryouts?
Of course. Head cheerleader and all.
Ahem...
I'll be at tryouts too.
Are you sure? If you're in pain you should rest.
I'm sure... I promise I'll take it easy. I want to be there.
Well I won't argue with that then, I'm happy you're going to be there.
Thanks for coming...
Of course Emiko. I'll see you in the morning.
I'll see you then [mcf].
A few moments later
How were they?
They're okay. We got invited to a party tomorrow night. Want to go?
I've never been to one. Are you going?
Yeah I told her I would.
Then sure, I'll go...
Perfect. You ready to go home now?
Yes I am.
Me and Shauna have a date planned so I'm going to drop you off but I'll be back in no time.
It's no rush. I hope you have a good date.
Thanks Stacy.
Me and Shauna do have a date planned though so I'm going to drop you off but I'll be back in no time.
It's no rush. I hope you have a good date.
Thanks Stacy.
A few minutes later
See you soon [mcf]! Thank you!
See you Stacy!
Shauna in a dress? She still has on sneakers though. I hope she never changes.
Hey.
Hi. You look amazing in that dress Shauna.
Hehe, [g1] picked it out for me. I couldn't do the heels.
I don't think I want to see you in heels, that's not the girl you are.
What do you mean?
I've never seen you wear anything like that. It's not your personality.
But if you did want to wear them, I'd have no problem with it.
Isn't it bad that I'm not that girly?
Not at all, you're you. I don't want you to force anything. I love you how you are.
Mwah!
I love you the way you are too.
Isn't it bad I'm not that manly?
What? How are you not manly?
Ha, people can say I'm too emotional?
How are emotions not manly?
Hiding your emotions out of fear of appearing girly is the least manly thing I can think of. Be you.
Plus if anyone tries to say otherwise just pull down your pants and show them your giant cock.
Haha, bold words Shauna.
Am I wrong?
I suppose not. Just not used to you talking like that.
Anyway, are you ready to go?
Absolutely.
Buckle up please.
A few minutes later
Oh thank god there isn't a bunch of kids in here. In fact I don't think anyone else is here at all.
Oh no...
What's wrong?
I thought this was the kind of arcade where you get tickets and prizes... it's just games.
That's okay, we both like games.
But... what about the prize at the end?
It's okay Shauna. You're wanting to recreate that night at the fair huh?
Kinda...
It was the night where I realized how I truly felt about you. I still have that dinosaur because it reminds me of you.
I just want to relive that night.
I get that Shauna and we will absolutely do it again sometime. But let's make some new memories.
We used to come to these kinds of arcades all the time. Know what never happened in them?
What?
We were never alone in one, and we weren't a couple then.
I remember us playing tag all the time in these. It used to be your favorite thing to do.
Anytime I thought you were getting bored I would tap you and yell tag. It would always make you have a huge smile on your face... before you would bolt at me.
Haha, I remember that. We got kicked out of that one arcade because we bumped into that lady and knocked her drink down.
You used to always start it, but hey... let's make new memories.
Tag! You're it!
Haha, better run!
Good thing she's not wearing heels.
I'm going to get you!
Which way are you going to go?
That's the oldest trick in the book Shauna! The simple answer is to go over!
Ahhh!
Haha! What are you doing Shauna?
I could easily tag her right now... but this is fun to watch.
What are you going to do now!?
Nice try, you do realize I play basketball though, right? I can just jump up there myself.
Oh... right.... Haha
Do it then.
If you insist.
Hi.
Hi.
We're going to get kicked out of here.
Haha, it'll be worth it.
Not going to tag me?
Not yet, I don't have a good getaway. You could just tag me back as I jump away.
Well then just sit up here with me.
Gladly. What do you want to talk about?
Can I ask you something?
Anything Shauna.
I miss [g1]...
I do too... but that's not a question?
Well... since this isn't the kind of arcade I thought it would be... What if we go back and pick up [g1]?
You really want to forfeit your 'alone time'?
Hey, don't get me wrong.
I love you, I love you so fucking much. I could spend the rest of my life alone with you.
I just feel bad leaving [g1] at home... I feel like she would enjoy being here.
Are you sure Shauna? I'd love for her to be here but I don't want you to feel like she has to be here.
I know, but I really do want her here.
All right, let's go get her then. Do you need help down from here?
Hehe, yes.
Just slide on down. I won't let you fall.
Don't drop me.
Cute panties...
Were you looking up my dress?
Ha, not on purpose. You spread your legs in front of my face.
I'm not used to dresses, they restrain a lot of movement.
I mean move however you want to around me, like I said... cute panties.
We should talk about that by the way...
Talk about what?
Our conversation this morning. About taking things slow.
What about it?
Is that what you want?
I want what you want Shauna. If you want to wait and build up our actual relationship then I'm more than happy to do that.
What if I do want the other thing?
Then I'd say we should still go slowly. Get you comfortable in your own skin.
Yeah... that would help wouldn't it?
I know you have these insecurities in your head that are holding you back.
We're going to get you past those. You're a beautfiul woman that should be confident in herself.
Mwah!
Okay... so slowly.
[mcf]? Shauna?...
[g1]???
What are you doing here?
What happened? Is everyone okay?
Mhmmm, I just needed to be around you two.
We're here for you [g1].
How did you get here?
The bus.
Babe... what happened?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to ruin your alone time.
You're not ruining anything. Me and Shauna were about to come get you.
What do you mean?
We both agreed that it didn't feel right being here without you. So we were going to come get you.
That's right, you're not ruining anything.
Awh... I love you both.
I love you too.
I love seeing you two together.
Shauna's really impressing me with how she's handling [g1]. From helping her after the rally yesterday and everything she's done since.
I'm really glad they're growing close so quickly.
So what were you two doing?
Hold on babe. You haven't told us what happened yet.
Let her sit down and talk.
It's not that big of a deal... I just felt alone after it happened.
After what happened?
Elizabeth and me got into an argument.
I don't even know what started it... but she said a lot of mean things.
Fuck... where was [am]?
[am] and Stacy went to Rachael's office. I stayed behind to wait on you two.
What made her go off on you?
She asked me if it was true that I was letting you be with other girls. I told her the truth and she started to yell at me.
That's awful...
Where is Elizabeth now?
She said she was going to go see about her dorm.
Good, she shouldn't be in the house if she's acting like that.
What the fuck happened to her?
But it's fine. I'm used to her acting that way. I just didn't want to be home alone.
I'm glad you came here babe.
I am too. Don't worry about her.
She's just jealous... she'll be okay.
Hey... do you want to go on a walk or something?
You don't want to stay here?
We have all these games at home and can play them for free whenever. You need some air.
Yeah, let's get out of here.
Are you sure?
We were probably going to do something else after we picked you up anyway.
You two are amazing.
I'm sorry about your sister... things will get better soon.
It's okay... I have new family now.
That's right, just don't give up on Elizabeth just yet.
Where do you two want to go?
You pick, we'll follow.
Hmmmm, I have an idea.
We'll decide after we visit a store. I need to get something for a headache.
Are you feeling okay? We can go home if you need to rest.
No, no. I'm fine. Let's go girls.
Lead the way.
A trip to the store later
Oh... it's that girl from class.
Her name was Ruby right?
Uhm, excuse me.
Oh hey [mcf]. How may I help you?
Huh, she has a bit of a wonky eye... Did she always have that?
Hey Ruby, do you sell any stuffed animals? Preferably big and hopefully you have two of them?
Uhmmm, I'm not sure. I'd have to check. Can you watch the front for me?
Sure thing.
She's pretty cute.
I need to get two stuffed animals this time. One for Shauna and one for [g1]. I just hope Shauna doesn't mind including [g1] in this.
Ow!
Oh! Ruby! Are you okay?
Yeah I'm fine! I'm just clumsy... I dropped your animals, do you want me to get two more?
Uhh, I think they'll be okay.
Here, let me help you up.
Thank you.
I really need to start wearing my glasses... anyway...
Thank you for your purchase. Come back anytime.
I'll see you in class Ruby.
Wait, are you going to Zoe's party?
Yeah, I believe I am. What about you?
I think so, probably will.
Cool... hey, one more question.
Do you know any cool hang out spots around here?
There's this one gazebo with pretty lights. It's nothing special but it's about as good as you'll get.
Can you tell me where it is?
I'll send the directions to you.
Thanks Ruby.
No problem and I'll see you in class okay? Have a good night.
Goodnight Ruby.
A few minutes later
What are we doing here [mcf]?
Ruby told me about this place. Figured it's exactly what we needed.
It's perfect baby... just a nice pretty place with fresh air.
Well let's sit and relax.
So... how did the start of your date go?
We played tag and talked about some things.
Like what?
How we missed you.
You two talked about me the whole time?
Girls I'm tired, let's lay down for a moment.
And we talked about a few other things, getting Shauna more comfortable in her body.
Oh yeah?
What [g1] is trying to get at is that we talked about us taking it slow.
Sorry... I told her while you were in the store.
Snitch.
Haha, sorry.
Ha, you could've just started with that [g1].
You want to know what really helped me with my confidence?
Working out everyday with him?
Well that helped... but it was just doing it. Turn that voice in your head off.
Kind of like this.
[g1]!
You don't mind do you babe?
Uhh... [g1]?
What? Do you want me to stop?
That's not what I'm trying to say... it's just Shauna.
Mwah!
If you're scared we're freaking out Shauna... why don't you ask her?
What has gotten into her?......
I kind of like it though.
Shauna?
Haha...
What's funny?
We talked about this while you were in the store too.
Ahh, I see.
I wonder what goes through that brain of yours... what makes you so damn perfect?
Hehe, I thought you'd be upset at me for tricking you.
You're too sexy for me to think about anything else right now.
Mmmm... what are you going to do about that?
Haha... baby.
Are you sure you're okay doing this in front of Shauna?
We're both your girlfriends, I'm sure she's going to walk in on us again sometime and I'll walk in on you two. Might as well get used to it.
That's true... well then, let's take those clothes off.
Only me? What about Shauna?
What? I thought I was just watching?
You don't have to Shauna. It could really help you feel more comfortable around us though.
Do you really want to sit in the corner awkwardly or would you like to enjoy yourself too?
You don't have to do anything with us, just have a good time yourself.
Are you saying what I think you are?
What? Masturbate? Everyone masturbates, it's not weird.
It is a little bit.
No reason to push her on this, rather just make sure she's comfortable and has a good time.
How about this? We won't look. You sit by and watch, have a good time yourself and we all grow closer. Everyone wins.
Promise not to look?
Promise.
Promise.
Okay... sure.
Perfect, thank you Shauna.
Oh? You're already undressed?
That outfit is really easy to get off. Now it's your turn.
You're so fucking sexy [g1].
Mmmm, so are you... Now lay on your back.
Last time we were like this... I couldn't really walk for the entire rest of the day.
We can start with something easier babe.
I think I can do it.
Jesus, does Shauna not realize she's undressing right in front of me?
I mean to be fair she's either in mine or [g1]'s vision, guess she'd rather me see.
She has an amazing ass too.
*whispering*[mcf], stop looking.
She's undressing right in my vision.
I know but you made a promise. Just look at what we're doing.
You're right, are you ready?
Mhmmm.
Ahhhhhhmmm....
[g1], are you sure you want to start with this?
Mhmmmmm....
I'm great [mcf]. I promise this will feel great for both of us.
Watch this.
AHHHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!
Holy fuck!!
[g1]??
Oh fuck!
Shauna, it's okay.
Ohhhh.... What happened?
Your moan made Shauna turn around.
Poor girl... Give me a second baby.
What's wrong Shauna?
Can I put my clothes back on?
No Shauna. You have nothing to hide.
What's so scary about showing down there?
.....
Come on, turn around. I won't look.
Is it because I'm here?
A little bit.
I understand. I'm nervous to be naked in front of you too.
And I love you Shauna but I'm not here for you, just like how you're not here for me.
We're here for [mcf]. We don't need to worry about each other. But I do think you're gorgeous.
Are you scared to let him see?
I don't know...
How about we try it? We'll both just stand here and let him look. And he'll be honest with us about how he feels.
Okay...
Don't be nervous Shauna. It's me.
What do you think? Be honest.
I wouldn't change a thing about either of you. That's the truth.
You're both incredibly sexy and I'm lucky to be here with you both.
And if that isn't enough to convince you Shauna... look at this.
He's as hard as a rock... you can't fake that.
You really mean it [mcf]?
I wouldn't lie to you Shauna.
So please relax and just have a good time. Enjoy this.
What he said.
Do you want to see more?
Really? Of course I do.
Here, give me a second.
Good job baby.
You too, you've been an immense help.
We make a good team... do you want me to show off with Shauna?
Is that even a question?
Hehe.
I'm so proud of you Shauna.
Fuck girls... I have nothing but positive things to say.
You're both perfect in your own unique ways.
I can't wait anymore baby.
Oh yeah?
Come here then...
Are you watching Shauna?
Mhmm...
Stick it in me [mcf]... I've been waiting all day for it.
Ohhhhmmmm... Fuck yes baby...
Go deeper...
Fuck me... caveman brain is taking over again...
Ahhhh!! Ohhh my god...
Hmm, I wonder if Shauna is enjoying the view.
He, I'd say she is.
I wonder how nervous she really is right now, I know she's putting on a bit of a brave face.
I'm just happy she's trying.
Oh, she's making eye contact and she didn't even stutter...
Maybe she isn't as nervous as I thought she was.
Fuck it, let's give her a show to remember then.
Baby! What are you doing?
Switching positions... are you ready?
Fuck me baby...
[g1]??
Oh fuck!
Shauna, it's okay.
Ohhhh.... What happened?
Your moan made Shauna turn around.
Poor girl... Give me a second baby.
What's wrong Shauna?
Can I put my clothes back on?
No Shauna. You have nothing to hide.
What's so scary about showing down there?
.....
Come on, turn around. I won't look.
Is it because I'm here?
A little bit.

Baby! What are you doing?
Switching positions... are you ready?
Fuck me baby...
Oh!! Just like that!
Fuck me baby!!
You feel so fucking good...
Ahhhnnnnggg.... Enjoying the view... Shauna?
Mhmmm...
From a bathroom floor to a gazebo floor. Moving up in the world.
It feels even bigger than before!
Fuck baby... 
AHHhhhhnnnnggg!!
Ohhhh...... HNnnnngggg!!!
Phew... that was so fucking good [g1].
AHHHHHHOOOuuuunnnnnggggg!!!
Fuck... Baby...
Fuck... I don't think I'm done.
Ahhhnnng!
Phew... that was so fucking good [g1].
Fuck me... I have to pull out!
AHHhhhhnnnnggg!!
Ohhhh...... Ahhhmmm...
Phew... that was so fucking good [g1].
That was great...
You're getting better and better every single day.
How's Shauna doing?
Look for yourself.
I think she's close...
Yeah, I think you're right.
Help her out...
Really?
I mean... if you want to. It might go a long way for her confidence.
Uhhh. Sure.
Shauna... Don't freak out. Let me help.
[mcf]!!
Calm down... it's okay. Just relax.
Okay...
This will feel great... I promise. Just let me star-
Ahhhnnnngggh!!
Ohhhnnnnn!!......
Did she just?
I'm sorry... I was so close...
Haha, sorry for interrupting.
No, no. It helped.
Ehh, I don't know. I don't want to freak her out.
Ahhhnnnngggh!!
Oh shit, she really was close.
Ahhhh....
I think she's close...
Yeah, I think you're right.
Help her out...
Really?
I mean... if you want to. It might go a long way for her confidence.
Uhhh. Sure.
Shauna... Don't freak out. Let me help.
[mcf]!!
Calm down... it's okay. Just relax.
Okay...
This will feel great... I promise. Just let me star-
Ahhhnnnngggh!!
Ohhhnnnnn!!......
Did she just?
I'm sorry... I was so close...
Haha, sorry for interrupting.
No, no. It helped.
Ehh, I don't know. I don't want to freak her out.
Ahhhnnnngggh!!
Oh shit, she really was close.
Ohhhnnngghh....
Ahhhh....
Babe...
This was our first time all together.
Yeah, it was.
I wish we had something to remember it by.
I still need to give them the stuffed animals.
Ha, yeah me too.
Should we get dressed? It's starting to get chilly.
Yeah we should. It was also pretty risky to be out here this long anyway.
One clothes change later
That was fun...
Would you do it again Shauna?
Of course.
Hopefully sooner rather than later.
True... can you girls excuse me for a moment? I need to grab my phone from the car.
Are we not about to leave?
We are, but I'll be right back.
Uhhh... okay.
Well they definitely know I'm about to pull something.
I'm a basketball player... not an actor.
I really did leave my phone though.
A message from Rachael.
[am] said to bring the girls to my office tonight. We're staying here. xoxo
What? That place was empty except for only one bed.
It works out though, I don't really want to be around the house ever since I found out about Ryker.
Let me give these girls these animals then we'll head that way.
What are you about to do?
You're clearly up to something.
Hmmm, just close your eyes and put out your hands.
They can probably already see these things behind my back.
Huh, no retort from either one of them.
Okay, open your eyes.
[mcf]!
[mcf]!
Thank you! You didn't forget!
I told you I'd get the biggest stuffed animal I could find Shauna. That's exactly what I did.
You don't mind that we get [g1] in on this do you?
Absolutely not, if you only got me one I'd be giving it to her.
I love you.
I love you too.
Thank you babe. I love you.
And I love you.
Are you girls cool going to Rachael's office? [am] wants to stay there tonight.
Uhh, sure I guess.
It's cool with me.
Perfect, let's get going then. It's getting really late.
Still empty.
It's a big place.
They should be right back here.
Yep.
Man, I haven't seen much of [am] at all today.
I need to spend some time with her before bed.
Welp, Rachael sees me.
There he is.
There you are honey! Did you have a good date?
Yeah I did. I had a great time.
That's fantastic.
I really missed you today mom.
I missed you too.
We need to make some more time for just the two of us.
We really do. Sometime soon I promise.
I love you mom.
I love you too honey.
Part of me wants to give her a friendly kiss but I don't know how she'd feel about that in front of Rachael.
Mwah!
Well damn, I guess she doesn't mind very much at all.
I hope that didn't give Rachael any ideas.
Rachael said she needed to talk to you again so I'll be back okay?
Okay mom, I'll be here.
Watching you two interact makes me think about having a son...
He'd probably turn out to be a shit head though.
And it's not really you I need to talk to... it's your girlfriend.
Oh...
Babe!
Yes?
Yes?
Ha, it was bound to happen eventually.
Uhh, [g1] I need you for a second. I'll talk to you in just a moment Shauna.
Fuck...
What do you need?
Rachael wants to talk to you.
Oh... okay.
You want me to handle this?
Sure, go for it.
Okay... so basically I have a business opportunity for [mcf].
Me and him can make a lot of money together and can get you guys out from under that creep Charles.
Not to be rude but why do you have to talk to me about this?
Because your boyfriend has a conscience.
What does she mean?
Just listen to what she has to say [g1].
Fuck me, I feel awkward right now.
Okay... so basically.
Actually [mcf]... Can you leave us to chat for a moment? This is a bit hard to do with you standing right there.
Oh... sure.
It's okay baby. I'll be here.
Guess I'll go make sure Shauna is good.
Babe!
Ha, fucking jerk.
You know you're my babe too Shauna. Easy mishap.
Mwah!
Damn right I am.
[mcf], Shauna...
Hey Stacy. How's it going?
It's going well. How was your date?
Absolutely nothing to complain about.
That's good.
Were you still wanting to talk tonight? You know? Get to know each other?
Yeah I'd love to. Do you want to right now?
Sure...
Well, I'll leave you two to it.
You don't want to share any stories?
Not really...
Fair enough. We'll be over here if you need us.
Roger, roger.
So... tell me about yourself.
Can I get closer?
Yeah, sure.
Better. What do you want to know?
Hmmm... why do you hate basketball?
My mom hated it. Guess I just took after her.
What's your relationship with your mom like?
It was great... then she sent me off here a year early.
Why did she do that?
My guess is as good as yours...
Ummm, what family do you have?
Just my mom. That's all I've ever known. No grandparents or anything.
Me and my mom were broke pretty much my entire childhood. Jumping city to city.
Always switching schools so I never really had friends.
That's why I'm so happy I found you.
I was so nervous coming here.
I heard a lot of stories about this place and not many were nice.
But you're the nicest person I've ever met.
Stacy...
AAAAAHHHHH!!!!
What was that?!
Fuck that was an actual scream from her.
Mom!
Come here!
There was someone looking in the window! They were in a hoodie!
Mom, it was probably just a homeless guy looking for a place to sleep.
Honey this was different!
I'll check it out. Go back with the other girls.
If this is any of those creeps associated with Charles...
Oh shit... there they are.
They don't look homeless... and it's a woman... Is that the girl from Charles' office?
Hey! Can we talk for a second?
What the fuck they're running.
Hey!
Fuck, I feel like I need to chase... but what if it's just an innocent woman that's creeped out?
I can't risk it... and she's not very fast.
Stop!
If she makes this turn I can just jump these boxes and grab her...
I said stop!
In case this is just some random woman I need to take the impact of the fall, sort of like with Natalie.
Ahhhh... that hurt...
I'm sorry, you wouldn't stop... Why were you peeking in on us?
*Sobbing* I'm so sorry.
Hey, hey... it's okay.
You didn't do anything wrong.
She's hugging me so tightly...
What did you do?
I'm so sorry [mcf].
I didn't want to run... I didn't know what else to do.
She knows my name, and she smells so familiar.
Who are you?
[mcf]...
Mom??...
Fuck... I'm so dizzy...
...
...
[mcf]!
Huh? Mom?
Is that Stacy?
Come on buddy. We need to leave before daddy gets home.
Come on!
Where are we going?
On vacation.
Without dad?
He's going to meet us there...
Help me finish packing please.
Fuck, my head is still spinning...
...
...
PUT HIM DOWN!
YOU'RE NOT TAKING MY SON!
I SAID PUT HIM DOWN!
What the fuck was that?
Was that really my mom? Or was that all just a dream?
And Stacy... there's no way.
What the fuck is going on?...
That's a good idea. What do you have in mind?
At least Shauna and [g1] are here right now...
I don't know... I just hate seeing him like this.
He's always the one doing things for us... we should do something for him.
I think you've been pretty giving recently.
You know what I mean Shauna.
I wonder how that talk with Rachael went...
He says he's just been stressed. We should try to help with that.
What do you have in mind?
Hmmm... we should surprise him with something.
Like when he comes home we surprise him with food, a comfy bed, a big tv, and us to cuddle with. Just so he can relax.
You know that's not how [mcf] is. He's not one to relax.
I know... I just don't want to see him like this anymore...
Fuck... I need to let them know I'm okay.
I don't either [g1]. He has us though, everything is going to be okay.
We'll figure out what happened when he gets up.
Girls?
[mcf]!
Are you okay?
I'm fine... I'm sorry for worrying you girls.
What happened?!
[am] said she saw someone outside, I went to check it out.
I saw a woman walking and tried to get her attention. She ended up running so I gave chase.
At the risk of sounding crazy... I ended up tackling her to the ground.
She started to apologize, that's when everything started to piece together.
Her smell, her voice, everything. Then she looked up... I think she was my mom.
Lay back down honey...
I know I sound crazy babe. It's the truth.
I'm not saying it isn't the truth... it is crazy though.
I'm worried about you... You have so much on your plate right now.
Maybe you should talk to someone about it? Like a professional...
Babe...
Don't answer yet, just think about it... please.
I promise I'll think about it. Just please don't worry about me.
Mwah!
You know I always will.
Ha, fair.
I'm going to go wake up [am] and let her know you're awake.
No, you don't have to wake her up. Let her rest.
The only way we could get her to lay down is if we promised to wake her up the second you got up.
Oh...
I'll be right back.
Are you sure you're okay?
I think so Shauna. I don't feel like there's anything wrong.
Are you going to see a therapist?
I don't know.
[mcf] please... There's something wrong and we don't know how to help you.
I love you... I just know that you think you can overcome anything.
You've always been a rock in my life... seeing you unconscious was weird. It felt wrong.
We just want to know that you're okay. Just please go for us?
We've been sitting on this bed waiting for you to wake up for hours... we just...
Shauna, I promise I'll go.
Really?
Yes, we'll find one for me today okay?
Okay. Thank you.
I'm sorry to push it...
Don't say that. I'm glad I have two girls that care enough about me to push me.
You two are right. This may be bigger than me and a therapist might be just what I need.
I thought it was over after the last one.
I swear that was my mom though...
Thank you...
Mwah!
I love you too by the way.
Hey, uhhh... what time is it? How long was I out?
Last I checked it was close to 3am.
Phew... good. I have to be at practice at 5am for the tryouts.
You and [g1] have been up all night?
Yep, by your side.
[mcf]!!
Mom...
Come here!
What happened? Are you okay? Tell me...
I thought you were asleep? You seem wide awake.
I couldn't sleep, don't worry about me right now. What happened out there?
I'm okay mom. What all do you know?
I made you go outside when I saw someone creepy looking in...
You didn't make me do anything mom.
Then I was back here with the girls waiting on you to come back. That's when we heard knocking.
Rachael went to check because we thought you might've just been locked out.
That's when she found you on the ground outside the door. What happened?
I'm not sure... I know I had another dream.
I think I chased down the person you saw. I tackled them.
I think that person may have been my biological mom.
What? How?
She had on a hoodie so I couldn't tell at first. But when I tackled her she started to apoligize and I saw her face. That's when I remember getting dizzy and having another dream.
Are you sure it was her?
I think so, I just don't know how much of it was real or a dream.
I'm sorry for keeping you up.
Hush honey, don't apologize to me.
I can't remember the last time you were up this late.
It's been awhile... I just couldn't sleep.
Were you three on another bed?
Yeah, one just like this one but in the other room.
What do you say we all cuddle up and sleep in this one then? That might help you sleep.
I'd like that...
That does sound like a great idea. We can sleep in.
You girls can. I have to be at practice in a few hours.
Don't you think you should stay home today?
Me, Shauna, and Stacy talked about taking today off from school and helping Rachael move her things in here, plus we haven't slept.
Well... how about I go to practice but come back here when that's over?
That way I can also tell Veronica why we won't be in class.
Will you promise to take it easy? Harper will tell me if you don't.
Heh, I promise.
And [g1]...
I'm going to find a therapist for me today.
Really? Thank you baby... Me and Shauna will help you find one.
We also have a lot to talk about... so let's get some rest and worry about that when you get home okay?
Sure thing. I love you.
I love you too.
Roll over mom. Let me put my arms around you.
Can I ask something dumb?
Heh, what is it?
If it was your real mother...
Hey, hey. I know where you're going with this.
It doesn't matter who she was. It doesn't matter how we ended up here.
You're my mom. No matter what happens that will always be the truth. You raised me.
We've been through it all together. No matter the circumstances you made sure I was safe and that I had food on my plate.
I'm the man I am today because of you. Not her.
All the sacrifices you've made for me... I'll never forget.
Mwah!
I'd do it all over again if I could. I love you honey.
I love you too mom... now get some rest.
Goodnight girls... I love you all.
Goodnight everyone. I love you all too.
Goodnight kids... I love you all aswell.
Goodnight... You guys took all of the I love you's so I'll just repeat it. I love you all.
An hour an a half later.
I keep falling in and out of sleep...
I think it's time for me to get up anyway.
Now just to do it without waking any of the girls.
Slowly...
And I'm up.
Time for tryouts... then helping Rachael move some things.
[mcf]? You up?
Oh hey Rachael. What are you doing up?
Was going to check on all of you. Are you okay?
I'm fine. When you found me out there... was there anyone else?
No, it was just you on the ground. I freaked out a little bit thinking you were hurt.
But you didn't have any scrapes except one on your back. It wasn't bad though. Still had your wallet and everything also.
Took an hour to convince [am] to not call 911.
[g1] told me what you said happened when she told [am] about you being awake.
I don't know if that's what really happened though.
I'll look into it for you. Are you going to help me move some things today?
I am. As soon as I get back from practice. And thank you Rachael.
Thank you as well.
Hey, how did the talk with [g1] go?
It went better for you than it did for me. You have a little business woman in the making.
What do you mean?
We'll both explain it later. Just focus on practice for now.
Sounds good Rachael. Have a good day.
You too hun.
Phew... okay. Got out of here without having to see Stacy. Not sure if I could handle that right now.
[mcf]?
Fuck...
I have a bad feeling in my stomach.
Where are you going?
I have to be at practice by 5. What are you doing up?
I don't sleep much... and slept in the middle of the day yesterday.
Are you okay?
I'm fine Stacy, thanks for worrying.
Of course. I enjoyed our talk last night. I wish we could've finished it... maybe tonight?
Sure. I'd like that.
That could help me figure out some things.
Can I give you a hug goodbye?
You don't have to ask Stacy. Come here.
Have a good practice.
Thank you. I hope you have a good day too.
Mwah!
Oh, she just kissed my cheek.
What was that for?
Everything. That wasn't too far was it?
No, I don't mind. It's just a kiss on the cheek.
Good, so I'll see you later?
Sure will. See you Stacy.
A few minutes later
I thought this dream stuff was over... Life feels so different than it did a few days ago.
I used to feel like I fit in my place. Just secure. Now it feels like I'm thrown everywhere and can't settle down.
I've barely played basketball or even been to a gym. Hopefully that changes today.
I should leave this car at WVM also. If I'm giving up the houses then the car has to go as well.
Huh? Who is that?
No shoes and she looks like she has a limp.
Fuck... I have a few minutes. I should stop and see if she needs help.
Ma'am? Do you need help?
She looks familiar but I can't see her face. I have to lean over.
Oh fuck...
Willow? What's going on?
...
Here, get in.
I don't like the girl but she clearly needs some help.
...
Come on Willow. I can take you home.
Are you okay? Do you need help?
No... home is fine...
Can you give me directions?
Take a left.
A few minutes later
This is your place?
Yes.
Can I walk you inside? I just want to make sure you're good.
What the hell happened to this girl?
Mhmm.
Not a bad place.
Do you need anything else Willow?
...
Can you come inside for a moment?
I really don't have much time... not like I can really say no right now though.
Sure, I can't stay for long though.
So... can you tell me anything?
No... Not right now.
What do you want me to do Willow?
I don't know... stay...
I'm sorry... I have to go to practice. You can come if you want to.
No...
I can come back later?
I'll take that as a yes.
I'm not sure when... but I'll be by sometime soon.
I didn't mean it...
Mean what?
About [g1].
Oh... thank you. Don't worry about that right now. Focus on you. I'll be back sometime today okay?
Bye...
I feel awful leaving but I promised Harper I'd be there at 5.
I wonder what happened to her. I need to come back here as soon as I can.
One trip to practice later.
I love the smell of this place. About the only familiar smell here.
Where is everyone?
Oh, it's just Harp... Hopefully it's not another no show day.
Coach!
[mcf]! You're late.
Sorry... last night and this morning were weird.
It's only by a few minutes. Thank you for coming.
So where is everyone?
In the other room.
How many?
Counting Ayden? Four.
Awesome. What's the plan for today?
I'll go over that whenever everyone is here.
For now you should go get changed into your practice clothes.
Will do coach.
Wait.
Your good morning hug...
Just what I needed.
Natalie told me all about your date. She seemed to have a really good time.
I'm happy for you two. Thanks for that.
Is she here this morning?
Not yet. She was getting ready when I left so she should be here somewhat soon.
Now go get changed.
Yes coach.
Cool logo...
These are a lot like the lockers at my old gym.
A few moments later.
These are much better than the old ones. Way more comfortable.
[mcf]. What's up?
Oh hey, good morning Damien.
How are you?
Ehh, weird night last night. What about you?
The same. Me and Jasmine talked for like 5 hours.
Oh yeah? How'd that go?
Started out awfully but gradually got better. Not really sure where it's at now.
But hey, that's not why we're here this morning.
True, everything is good with you and Jasmine though right?
Should be.
Hey, are you free any today?
Probably not. What did you have in mind?
Just wanting to hang out. What do you have planned?
I have to help a woman move some things into her office.
Want some help?
You'd be willing?
Yep. Sure am. No flaking this time either, I promise.
I'm sorry for the first time. That isn't like me. Let me make it up to you.
I won't say no to help Damien. You good to head there after practice?
Sure thing.
Thanks man. Means a lot.
No problem... so... time to meet the new guys huh?
Sure is.
That's nice of him... at least he's trying.
I wonder what Jasmine thinks about their talk last night though.
I wonder what Harp has in mind for us today.
Hopefully nothing too intense. I don't feel completely right today.
Oh, hey you two. Ready?
Sure am.
Can you go get them Damien?
Yeah I can do that coach.
Excited?
Sure, what about you?
Yeah... a little nervous though. Meeting new players can be tough. I have to be Coach Harper not just Harper.
I think you're great at both.
Yeah? You think I could just be Harper and get away with it?
I love your smile but you're a little too smiley for a coach. You have to be a little more stern or players might try to take advantage of you.
Like this?
Ha, tone it down just a bit. Look approachable but not too approachable. If that makes any sense.
This?
Perfect. Just like that.
Thanks! I'm going to go help Damien bring them in here. Stay here.
Will do coach.
I feel like dunking today... but I really should try to take it easy...
I wonder what seeing a therapist is like. I wonder if I'll like it.
... I can't get my mom out of my head. That had to be her. It felt too real... and Stacy.
Fuck me... my thoughts are so jumbled right now.
Maybe I am just crazy.
[mcf]. There's some guys to meet.
Oh shit.
Come here. Let me introduce you.
This is Dubaku. He is transferring from track and field.
It's nice to meet you Dubaku.
Nice to meet you too.
And we have Marcus and Kenji.
Nice to meet both of you.
...
Likewise.
You're the famous guy right?
I guess.
Me and you need to talk. Later.
Sure?
Okay everyone. We're starting with laps, let's get loosened up.
Thoughts?
Better than I thought they would be. Kenji is huge and Dubaku doesn't seem bad either.
Marcus lacks the height though.
Yeah I know. But he may surprise us.
Very true, I hope he does.
Welp, time to start running.
Going to join us?
Ha, my legs are still jelly... now start running.
Many laps later.
Okay guys! Huddle up.
Now that we're warm. We're going to play a quick 3v3. Black shirts versus yellow shirts.
[mcf] and Damien don't try to show off. This is about seeing what the new guys can do.
Don't worry. We'll have our chances to show off soon.
Ha, I can't wait.
Your team gets ball first.
What's up Ayden?
It's going man. Not happy being up this early... but here we are.
I understand that. Let's show Harp what you guys can do.
I should have the ball as little as possible right now.
I'm not sure how Dubaku plays but I'm not sure I trust Ayden's ability either.
Kenji is two feet taller than Marcus. Plus he's already in the box.
Who do I throw it to?
Let's see what he has.
He has inside position, if he can twist around and get past Dubaku's hand then he should have an easy layup.
And he went straight up with it...
At least Dubaku knew how to play it.
Let's see what Kenji can do.
He has the size and power to just push Marcus back and have an easy post score.
Good shit Kenji.
Marcus had no chance.
And he made the shot. That's encouraging.
I wonder why Kenji wasn't already playing basketball.
A few minutes later.
Oh man. I'd love to a little eurostep layup right now...
Coach said this isn't about me or Damien though and Kenji has Dubaku beat.
Let me throw it up for him and see what happens.
Damn, Kenji is impressing me.
And it's not like Dubaku played that awfully either.
These two seem better than Mackey and Ayden.
A few more minutes later.
Oh, I'm in iso with Marcus. I should pass out of this but I want to see how Marcus will handle me.
I'll start off basic.
.....
..... I didn't even do anything.
Are you okay?
Uhh huh...
[mcf]! Come here for a second!
What do you think so far?
Kenji and Dubaku should be on the team. Marcus... not so much.
I was thinking the same thing. I think I'm going to tell him to go home...
I'm going to run the other three through some drills. You don't have to stay around for those. Just stay available because I want an actual game out of you today.
Sounds good with me Harp. I mean Coach.
I'll find you when I need you.
How did I do?
You did well. Definitely well enough to get a spot on the team if you keep it up.
Good. Thanks for answering.
[mcf]!
Zoe!
Still on for my party tonight?
Probably. Depends on how the day goes.
Hmmm, you don't want to miss it. I can promise you that.
Why's that?
You'll have to come and find out.
I'll try to Zoe. What are you about to do?
I'm about to go do some stretches in the weight room.
I have a free moment. Can I join you?
Of course you can. Follow me.
Hmmm, Zoe is usually accompanied by Emiko. She must have ended up sleeping in a bit or something.
Here we are! Nice right?
Ha, it's a lot like my old gym... just like the locker rooms. 
The color scheme and floor is way cooler though.
Yeah I like the stars too. I'm going to change into something else real quick. So just wait on me okay?
You got it Zoe.
This is where mine and [g1]'s spot was in the old gym. I miss working out with her.
I wonder if I could talk her into coming here. If I can bring her here anyway.
It will be nice to check her out while she works out and not feel guilty for it.
Maybe I can even convince Shauna to give it a shot.
Okay I'm back.
Damn, nice outfit Zoe.
Hehe, thanks. So are you going to stretch with me?
I'll give it a shot.
Okay follow my lead.
This is the upward facing dog... Just stretch out...
This feels pretty good. Helps to have the view of Zoe's ass in yoga pants though.
Okay... moving on.
This one is all about flexing out your core.
Like this?
No, no... Close though. Let me help.
Try to straighten up a bit.
Uhhh Zoe...
What?
Your foot...
Do you want me to move it?
Now's not the time Zoe.
Ugh... You're no fun.
Sorry Zoe...
Guess I'll leave you be then...
No Zoe. I'm enjoying the stretching... let's just keep it to that though.
Hmmm... Fine...
No, it can stay...
Hmmm... Good answer. I hope you don't mind if I.
Fuck Zoe. Not shy are you?
Never have been. I know what I want.
And that's you at my party tonight.
It feels like the thing in your pants wants to go.
It's not about not wanting to go. It's about time.
Well then make some time.
Okay, okay. I'll be there.
Good boy.
Woah, woah. Where are you going?
If I let you finish right now you wouldn't come to the party. We'll have a good time later tonight, don't worry.
Here... I'll even give you a little extra.
I just want you to come to my party is all. The foot was too far but what about this?
Jesus Zoe.
Nice right?
You can say that...
They'll be at the party tonight... waiting on you.
Okay Zoe. You clearly really want me there so I'll be there. Or at least I'll try my best to be there.
Damn Zoe.
So you promise you'll be there?
These will be there tonight... all for you.
Yeah, yeah. I promise I'll be there.
That's all I wanted. Try to be there early so we have some alone time.
I'll try to Zoe.
Who is that walking up?
Oh shit, hey Bailey.
Good morning [mcf].
I'll leave you two to it.
How did you sleep last night?
Last night was a little-
Mwah!
Sorry, I've been thinking about doing that since you left yesterday.
Ha, I'm not complaining.
Soooo... did you get a chance to talk to [g1] about us?
Uhh... not exactly. I was about to say last night was strange.
Oh... well that's okay. I know you'll ask when you can.
I'm not impatient. As long as I can hug and kiss you I'll be happy.
I'll ask her today, I promise.
There's no rush.
Will you be at Zoe's party tonight?
Yeah, Zoe was selling me on it before you came in. I think I'll be there.
Good... Are you bringing anyone?
Probably everyone... [g1], Shauna, and Stacy. Elizabeth if I get a chance to talk with her also.
I saw her just a minute ago... Do you think we could hang out some at the party?
Sure thing Bailey. I'm sure we'll have some time for just us.
In fact I'll make sure there's time for us... I still have to finish what I started in that kitchen.
[mcf]!
What? Got something against it?
..... No, I don't.
Haha, I didn't think so.
Where is Zoe going?
How did you sleep last night?
Last night was a little strange. But when I did sleep it wasn't bad.
Yeah, same here honestly.
Uhhh... are you going to Zoe's party tonight?
Yeah, Zoe was selling me on it before you came in. I think I'll be there.
Good... Are you bringing anyone?
Probably everyone... [g1], Shauna, and Stacy. Elizabeth if I get a chance to talk with her also.
I saw her just a minute ago...
Do you think we could hang out some at the party?
Oh wait, you're going? Hmmm, I might not go after all then.
Ha! What's that supposed to mean?!
I'm just joking with you Bailey. Of course we can hang out.
Where is Zoe going?
Oh shit it's Elizabeth... She doesn't seem very happy to see me.
I should talk to her and hopefully find out her side about what happened last night.
I'm sorry Bailey, can you excuse me for a moment?
Oh... sure.
Elizabeth...
...
You have to talk to her too?
Yeah I do.
Hmmm, you agreed to come to my party so I'll let you talk to her first.
Thanks Zoe.
Liz, what did you say to [g1] last night?
...
...
Come on Liz, you've never been afraid to speak your mind before.
Just tell me what you're thinking.
...
My sister is an idiot.
Liz, what makes you say that?
She was lucky enough to have you... what the fuck is she doing?
She's just letting you go and be with anyone. That's weird [mcf].
Now I have to see you with all these other girls.
Seeing you with my sister was hard enough.
Liz...
Don't 'Liz' me right now...
You should realize how your actions effect the others around you.
What would my mom think if she saw her daughter's boyfriend sleeping around on her?
It's not like that.
I don't want to hear it. I'll be staying with a friend. You have fun with all of your girls.
Elizabeth.
Fuck...
I don't think she's telling me the whole story.
I think she's more upset about the fact that I haven't asked anything from her.
She probably just feels a bit excluded. I should do something to fix that.
I need to see how [g1] will feel about it first though.
Everything okay?
Yeah... she's just having a hard time adjusting to things.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's not exactly an easy thing to adjust to. We'll figure it out.
You just giving her some space?
For now. But I think I can change her mind about things.
How so?
It's a little complicated. It will also take a bit of searching.
I actually might need your help setting it up.
Whatever you need.
Great, thanks Bailey. I'll let you know more whenever I have it more planned out.
Sooo... What do you have planned out?
If [g1] is okay with it... I want to remind Elizabeth of a few things.
I want to find a bunch of old pictures. I basically want to remind Elizabeth how much she means to all of us.
That's sweet... Where do I come in?
That part still has some planning. I'll tell you more about it at the party tonight.
[mcf]! Back in the gym!
Oh, drills are over?
Yep, all three of them did very well.
So I think we are going to have three new teammates.
That's awesome. So we're up to Me, Damien, Mackey, Lee, Ryker, Ayden, Dubaku, and Kenji.
That's 8. We can work with that. Ideally we can find two more.
I don't doubt it. I'm sure we will. We still have all of the old bench players to test out too.
I just really want my first win [mcf].
We're going to get you more than one Harp. How far away are we from our first game?
Well... We weren't scheduled for our first game until next Friday.
Jesus, that's early.
But... Since everyone is talking about WVM because of you. We were offered to swap games and have ours be the season opener.
So, early next week? And it will be broadcasted to the entire country?
Yeah.
Fuck...
Let me guess? That was a Charles decision?
Kinda, he asked me and I agreed. It's just preseason. It will be a good test to see where we are.
We barely have a team put together... I'll just trust Harp on this one.
Oh... Who are we playing?
They're called The Briars.
Briar? Like a thorn?
Well they've been a thorn in our side. We lost to them twice last year. First time by 22 points and second time by 38.
But this year will be different. I believe in you and this team.
We won't let you down Harp.
Now come on. Let's go play some basketball.
Bye [mcf]. I'll see you later.
Bye Bailey. I'll see you at the party tonight.
Not in class?
Not going to be able to make it today. I have some things I have to do.
Oh... well I'll keep your seat warm for you.
Haha, thanks Bailey. See you tonight.
See you [mcf].
I appreciate Harp's enthusiasm but I barely know my teammate's names still.
They don't know the playbook or anything. Hell, I barely do.
Guess we'll just have to step it up. We'll be playing in front of the entire country.
I need to get back on track myself. I've barely worked out or trained these past few days.
That needs to change and quick.
Looks like they're not back yet.
Where'd they go?
I let them take a break after drills.
Ha, I don't think I've ever had a coach that let me take a break mid practice.
What? It's only fair. I let you run off with Zoe mid practice. So they get a break too.
Fair point. With a game looming on us now we should amp up our practices. I know today is different because of tryouts but we need everyone here.
I know, let's sit and talk about this.
I talked to Mackey some yesterday. I don't know what happened but he has done a complete 180.
He's all about basketball. He would've been here this morning but I told him to take it off or come in at 7 like usual.
That's great to hear actually. Will he be here today?
He acted as though he would be. Tomorrow also.
Lee's going to be here then and we both know Damien will as well.
Dubaku, Ayden, and Kenji all seem committed. That's why we held tryouts at 5am.
Only those truly interested would show up.
The only question mark is Ryker. I heard you had a run in with him.
You could call it that. We don't need him Harp.
Like I said before... getting rid of Charles' nephew wouldn't be easy or worth the headache.
If he shows up, good. If he doesn't, we'll be okay.
So from here on out practices should go smoothly. 4v4's aren't the same as 5v5's. But we'll make it work.
Damn right we will.
Uh oh, heads up [mcf]!
What do you me-
Haha!
Got you!
Haha, I had to get you back for the other day.
I thought the other day was me getting you back for kneeing me.
Oh yeah... whoops.
Looks like we have a little war on our hands.
Oh damn, I didn't realize my head is in Harp's lap.
Mom, look away for a second.
Oh god, make it quick honey.
Mwah!
Are we even now?
I'd say we are.
There's something else I want to say but I should really refrain since Harp is right here.
Good. We're done now mom, you can let him up.
We could always end this little war here. Peace treaty.
Hmmm, I think I prefer retaliation.
Awh, come on.
I'll think about it.
You know I can hold you down for a bit right? Might want to rethink that answer.
Haha, fine. Peace treaty it is.
Good, you can let him up now mom.
Will you be at Zoe's party tonight?
Yeah I will be. What about you?
Absolutely. Wouldn't miss it.
That's not what I heard last night.
Mom...
Don't let my mom embarrass me too much. I have to go get things ready for class.
Ha, I won't let her. Not too much anyway. I hope you have a good day Natalie.
Thanks [mcf]. I hope you do too.
She told me last night that she wasn't going. Guess you going changed her mind.
Is that a bad thing?
No, no. It's cute.
Ayy! [mcf]!
Yo Ayden. Where's everyone else?
They're on their way.
You ready to crush this thing?
Always ready. What are we crushing?
Dubaku and Kenji.
2v2.
I haven't told him yet Ayden.
You two are just going to play a quick game of 21 against the other two.
Since I had to let Marcus go home we can't do a 2v3.
And I already know what Damien can do.
So it's just you four for right now.
Sounds good to me.
I'm going to get ready.
That's not an issue right?
What isn't?
Letting Damien skip out on this one.
No that's fine. Like you said you're still seeing what all of us can do and you already know what Damien is capable of.
I still have to see that for myself because all I've done so far is dunk on him but I'm sure that will happen soon.
I promise he's better than that.
I believe it.
[mcf]. Can we talk for a moment?
Veronica? I didn't expect to see you here.
I had to be here early for a meeting. Figured I would stop by just to thank you again for yesterday.
Nathan's mom called and told me he was a perfect angel to her after his talk with you.
Good, good. That's awesome.
It really is. You excited for class today?
Oh, about that...
What?
We're not going to be able to attend class today.
What do you mean 'we'?
Me, [g1]. Shauna, and Stacy.
[mcf]...
You have to be better than this. We're only three days in and you're already getting girls to skip my class.
I'm not going through this again young man.
Veronica, no. It isn't like that at all.
Hear me out.
Do you like Charles?
God no.
I'm currently staying at a place he owns. I have the opportunity to move out of there and I also have to help someone move into an office.
All of those girls live with me and are helping me move. That's all, has nothing to do with skipping and we'll be there tomorrow.
Oh...
Still, it looks bad on me when the only guy in the class is out and takes a chunk of girls with him.
I'll make it up to you Veronica.
I still owe you after what you did for me yesterday.
So we'll call it even... if you agree to stay after class tomorrow and make up the lesson you'll miss today.
Deal. Does that include the girls as well?
No, girls skip all the time but they don't put a target on my back like you do.
I told you there wouldn't be any special treatment, if anything there'd be less opportunities.
I get it, you have to set an example. Deal.
Deal, sorry for the bad cop routine.
I understand. We're all just trying to do our jobs.
I won't keep you too late tomorrow. You're a fast learner.
It would be ironic and hypocritical of me to be late to my meeting for scolding you on being absent. So I should get going.
Ha, I'll see you tomorrow Veronica.
See you [mcf].
That's fair. Veronica isn't bad to be around either so I really don't mind having to stay over.
Ugh...
What is it Harp?
Oh, it's nothing...
The look on your face says otherwise.
What look? I'm fine.
If you say so Harp.
That was definitely strange.
Okay, time for that 2v2. Go get ready.
Sure thing coach.
Everyone is here. Me and Ayden vs Dubaku and Kenji.
Everyone ready?
Ready to win? Yes.
We're ready.
You get ball first. You'll need it.
Okay big guy. You better be the one guarding me if you plan on trash talking.
Oh I am.
Let's go then.
What do you need from me?
Hmm, I don't think Kenji is that fast but Dubaku can play defense.
Play inside and wait for the ball, if you see me cut then you run to the outside and get Dubaku out of the box. If he stays I'll pass it to you.
If he follows you then I should have an easy score.
That's all?
That's all, just try your best to drain your shots and this should be easy.
Let's do it.
They talk a lot about you, I don't see it.
Keep talking.
I can just play him like I did Damien. He's not running at me but I know he can't keep up with me. As long as I can get around him.
Oh yeah, big boy is too slow to play that close to me.
Hopefully Ayden ran to the three point line.
Fuck, he switched to me. Ayden should be wide open but I think I can dunk on Dubaku. Set the tone and let them know who I am.
Wide open and his jumper looks much better already.
Definitely not perfect but it at least doesn't look like a toddler drinking from a sippy cup anymore.
Buckets!
Nice Ayden!
Kenji was a little too disrespectful. Got to show off a bit.
Too easy.
Still, not a bad effort by Dubaku. Definitely not a terrible defender.
Woo! Good shit [mcf]!
Now let's do that a few more times and end this thing.
Ha, that easy huh?
It's that easy.
10 minutes later
Huh, it really was that easy. It's already 18-0. Ayden is draining all of his shots and Kenji can't stop me.
He's also quiet now. Hell, he's playing a mile away from me.
So far back that I can just pull up a 3 and end this.
Kenji is just a little too slow for this.
That's game!
Let's go!
Good job [mcf] and Ayden!
21 to nothing. Maybe they're not as good as I thought they were.
No, they're definitely not bad. A few weeks of practice and we'll have them ready.
So if they're not bad... you're just that good?
You said it not me.
Haha, tired at all?
I can go all day coach.
Well save that energy, there's a few more things I want to run them through but you're all done for today.
So go hit the showers.
That's all?
For today, tomorrow we'll pick up where we left off here. With everyone.
I'll see you later tonight when I drop Natalie off at the party.
Okay coach. I'll see you then.
Have a good day [mcf].
I wonder if there are any courts near my house. I'd love to get the girls playing also.
Anyway, I should get these practice clothes off then hop into a shower.
Haha, stop it.
Oh? Is Damien here?
Oh what the fuck... What are they doing?
You know what? I don't want to know.
Lee was probably just helping him tie his shoe or something... fuck...
I'll just yell over to let them know I'll be walking by.
Yo! Damien!
Frantic rustling noises
What's up?
I'm about to head out, you still wanting to help out?
Sure do! Just send me the address and I'll be there!
Will do! I'm going to head to the showers and then I'll be gone.
Now just to walk to the showers and not make any eye contact.
That could have been anything. Lee could have just been helping Damien with a cramp.
It would be silly to jump to any absolutes.
Let me just get cleaned up. Get that off of my mind.
Showers are nice at least.
One shower later
My minds a bit scrambled. Not really sure what all I have to do today.
I know I need to help Rachael move and go to Zoe's party.
Oh, I also need to find a therapist.
Walking noises
Oh, someone's walking up. I've had my curtain open all this time.
Should really close it.
There we go. No accidental flashing today.
Is someone in there?
Yeah, I'm [mcf].
Oh, hey [mcf]. I'm Tia.
You're in my shower.
Tia? I don't think I know a Tia.
I'm sorry Tia, I'm almost done.
That's not good enough for me. I can't wait.
Well hello there.
Oh, that's the girl from my class.
Hi, I'll be out in just a second Tia.
Oh... I was prepared to kick you out. But I think you can stay.
Isn't this shower only for men anyway?
It is this year. Last year this was my shower and I come here early so I can use it.
Didn't know that. I just picked a random one. I'll get out of your way.
Shower is plenty big enough for two people.
Ehh, I was pretty much done anyways.
If you say so. Thanks.
See you Tia.
Time to head home. Well no, I need to stop by Willow's and check on her.
That should only take a minute.
A few minutes later
There's plenty of room. I'm just finishing up.
Perfect. I don't mind sharing with you.
You know I can see you undressing right?
You know I just barged in on you and saw you naked right? It's only fair.
It's a nice view.
Yeah?
What about this one?
Even better.
Heh, now move over. Give me some room.
We need tighter school uniforms. I didn't even notice she had that ass on her.
I wouldn't mind this view for every shower I take.
I really was almost done...
Do I just stand here awkwardly and wait? Make a move?
Anyone there?
A hot girl joins you in the shower and you just stand in the corner?
Maybe I like it when the girl makes the first move.
Getting naked and getting into the shower with you was the first move.
This place not private enough for you?
Do you know a better place?
There's the shower Charles uses. It's fancy and has a lock on it.
Can we get in?
Oh yeah. Follow me.
If she knew about this nice private shower why didn't she just go there herself?
Oh well, don't look a gift horse in its mouth.
It's actually hidden so don't tell anyone.
How do you know about it?
Another girl showed it to me.
Just follow me.
See? Nice right.
Yeah, it's very strange to be hidden though.
Charles is a strange dude.
You and him haven't done anything have you?
God no. He's a creep. But he's a creep that is out of town which means no one will bother us here.
Any complaints?
You're a very beautiful girl Tia.
Awh, you're quite handsome yourself. You're not just saying that so I'll touch your dick are you?
No, although knowing that you're about to do that definitely doesn't make you any less hot.
Well then we should start.
Seeing my ass bounce around wasn't enough to make you hard? Tough crowd.
I don't mind working for it.
It's already big and you're not even hard yet.
I bet I'm not the first girl to jump you in a shower.
I mean considering Shauna, nope.
How does my hand feel?
It feels great. Keep going.
I can feel you growing, stiffening up on me.
I'm going to have to change my angle to get a good grip on you.
Mmmm, here we go.
Ever since I met you the other day I knew I'd be on my knees for you.
This was my first chance. Every other time I've seen you, you were with someone else.
Be honest with me. Was that really 'your' shower?
Yes, it actually is. But I usually just wait for whoever is in it to leave. When you said it was you I figured I'd invite myself in.
And here we are.
Such a big boy. My hand can just glide on your cock all day.
Man, those big brown eyes staring at me while she strokes me...
You know, I shower there almost every morning.
I wouldn't mind having a shower buddy.
Yeah? I might pop in from time to time.
Mmmmm... do you have a condom?
Uhh, I came in here completely naked. I don't.
Damn...
Guess we're sticking to the basics today.
Not risking becoming a mom today. Even though this cock is very convincing.
Bring one next time.
I will. I'm enjoying this anyway.
I am too. Gives us something to look forward to. There's still a lot of fun things we can do. Like this.
Ohhh, that's good.
Mhmmmm.
She's moaning and making her tongue vibrate...
Hmmm, I planned on sucking you dry but I need something too. I'm so fucking hot.
Don't stick it in me. Just let me grind on it.
Promise.
I promise.
Jesus Tia, you weren't kidding. You're fucking hot down there.
It's your fault, now fix it.
If it goes in me then this is over.
Fuck me... this feels fucking great.
Your huge cock rubbing against my wet pussy. Against my clit...
Her thighs feel so different than [g1]'s. [g1] has soft inviting thighs and Tia's are toned and are squeezing me.
They're completely different but they're both great.
I want to squeeze every last drop out of you. I want you to shoot your cum across this room.
This started out kind of rough but her pussy is so fucking wet that I'm just sliding in and out now.
About to cum big boy? Give Tia what she wants.
Shoot your cum for me daddy.
AHHHNNNGHH!!..
Oh I can feel that cock throbbing! My thighs squeezing every bit of sperm that you have out.
So, was that a coincidence or do you just really like being called daddy?
Good timing, but I do like it.
Was I a good girl for daddy?
You were great.
Do I deserve a kiss?
Mwah!
Yes you do.
Thank you daddy. Get that condom and then make me scream it instead of just saying it.
You'll be seeing me soon Tia.
I should head out before the showers start to fill up.
Yeah, I left my clothes back at the other shower so I need to run back there.
I'll see you around Tia, thanks for this.
See you [mcf]. I'll clean up our mess and then head out.
Hmmm, not yet.
Maybe next time when I have a condom you can earn it.
Oooooh, yes daddy.
Get that condom and then make me scream daddy instead of just saying it.
You'll be seeing me soon Tia.
I should head out before the showers start to fill up.
Yeah, I left my clothes back at the other shower so I need to run back there.
I'll see you around Tia, thanks for this.
See you [mcf]. I'll clean up our mess and then head out.
Time to head home. Well no, I need to stop by Willow's and check on her.
That should only take a minute.
A few minutes later
Oh, she's sleeping. Guess she's skipping class too.
Her door is unlocked. It might be a bit weird to enter but I want to make sure she's okay.
Willow? Are you awake?
...
Nope, she's out. I can chill for a moment and see if she wakes up.
This really doesn't look like it would be Willow's place. Way too... colorful.
I could take a look around and see if I can learn anything about her.
I just can't see Willow hanging these up.
It's a cozy little place, I guess that's her bed.
Maybe I should put her in it.
Hnnnmmmmm...
Willow?
Guess she's just having a dream.
Ahhhhhnnn...
Willow? Everything okay?
Hnnnnaa....
Must be having a nightmare. Poor thing.
Let me get her to her bed. She might sleep better.
Please don't wake up and freak out.
Easy does it.
Damn, for one of the taller girls Willow sure is light.
She's out cold, I should just lay her down and then get out of here.
There you are. It's pretty hot in here so I'm going to leave her over the covers.
Guess I'm heading home now. I'll check on her again sometime.
[mcf]? Where am I?
Hey there sleepyhead. You're in your bed.
How did I get here?
I carried you. You were asleep on your couch.
Oh... are you leaving?
I was about to since you were sleeping.
No, I'm awake.
You want me to stay?
Yes.
Thank you again.
You're being awfully nice Willow.
And?
Just feels weird. I don't think you're a bad person or anything but you've came off pretty tough the few times we've talked.
I am, you helped me though so I'm being nice.
I'll probably go back to my usual self so enjoy this while you can.
Why not just be nice all the time?
Too much effort. It's just not who I am.
So, what did happen this morning.
Let's go back to the couch and talk there.
I just carried you up that ladder, but sure.
Sit.
So what happened? Tell me.
No.
No? Why not?
You don't need to know.
I would like to know.
You don't need to know [mcf]. Leave it alone.
You're a weird girl Willow. Are you safe? Will you need anymore help?
I don't know.
What the fuck Willow, just tell me. I can help. Whatever it is.
No, no. Don't get sad. I'm just frustrated. I want to help Willow.
I don't think you can [mcf].
Just explain whatever you're going through and I'll tell you how I can help.
It's not that simple.
I don't even know how to explain it. If I need you I'll let you know, okay?
Ugh, fine. Don't hesitate to call me.
I won't.
If you change your mind and need to talk about it. I'm only a phonecall away.
Lean back.
Why?
Just do it.
Willow, why are you sitting in my lap?
Because I want to.
We shouldn't.
It's not a move, I just wanted to sit here. It's nice isn't it?
I just wish I could understand you Willow. I haven't gotten there yet.
I'm really not that complicated.
Well I'd like to get to know you more.
Is there any chance you could apologize to [g1] for me?
Hmmm, can you just tell her I apologized?
Yeah, I can. If she asks you will you deny it?
No. Like I said I didn't mean it. Was just trying to make Rainn laugh.
We should hang out sometime. Do you have to do anything today?
Yeah I do. We'll make plans soon.
Mwah!
She just kissed my cheek...
You shouldn't do that Willow.
It was just a thank you for the ride this morning. Nothing more.
What was that for?
A final thank you for the ride this morning.
I know I'm not your favorite person so the fact you still picked me up was nice.
I told you I don't think you're a bad person Willow.
Can we just stay like this for a bit?
For a little bit sure. I do need to head home though.
Just a few minutes.
What the fuck?!
Elizabeth? What are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I just told you it was hard to see you with other girls and now you're here cuddling Willow.
I gave her a ride this morning. I just came by to check on her.
Does checking on her include holding her like a baby?
Leave.
Liz, talk to me.
I love and care about you. Nothing you said has to matter. You can come back with me and we'll work it out.
I know things are different and I know things changed quickly. But everyone is happy.
Why not me [mcf]?
We've talked about it, we wanted to give you time to get used to your new life here.
We wanted to make sure everything was good between everyone.
You need to go.
Liz...
...
At least I know where she's staying now.
I would've been scared about her staying with Willow but she really doesn't seem like a bad girl.
What was that about?
Elizabeth is [g1]'s sister.
Yeah I knew that.
What? She jealous that you're not including her in your little three way relationship?
That's why she was crying last night.
She was crying?
I helped her through it. Hey! That's how I can pay you back for the ride.
I'll get Elizabeth back on your side.
I'd appreciate some help.
I should probably leave though.
Let me give you a hug first.
Thanks for checking on me.
Anytime Willow.
I'll talk to her for you. Not really sure what to say but I'll figure it out.
I'll see you soon okay?
Sure will.
And if you tell anyone what happened here. I'll ruin your life. Understood?
Noted. Won't tell anyone.
And don't expect nice Willow all the time.
Bye [mcf].
See ya Willow.
A few minutes later
Feels good to be back here. I see they've been busy while I was gone.
Place seems quiet...
Damn, they've gotten a lot done actually. I wonder how much is left.
I hope we don't have to start moving stuff right away. I'd like to relax a bit.
Baby... Turn around.
[g1], you look amazing...
You like it?
I love it, I wouldn't mind coming home to this everyday.
We can make that happen. I love you [mcf].
I love you too [g1].
Are we the only ones here?
It's just me and Shauna. [am], Stacy, and Rachael all went to pick out some furniture.
We figured you've been so stressed lately... it might be nice to just lay in bed with your girlfriends.
I definitely wouldn't say no to it. Thank you girls.
It's what we're here for.
We have some things to talk about though babe.
Later, right now is about forgetting everything else for a little bit.
They talked about that this morning when they thought I was still out.
I'll relax for a bit and do whatever they want me to do. It sounds nice.
Well there is this one thing I can't get out of my head.
Oh? What is it?
What your ass looks like in that fishnet. Can you turn around for me.
Hehe, first...
Mwah!
Getting tired of my kisses yet?
Not even close. Keep 'em coming. Well, after I get a view anyway.
Oh yeah, you're never allowed to take that off.
Haha, I'll put it on anytime you want me to baby.
Oh, getting handsy?
Can't help myself.
I don't mind... babe?
Yeah?
Would you change anything about me?
Not a damn thing. You're perfect to me.
Hehe...
You're perfect to me too. So...
You ready to relax?
Yeah, I believe I am.
Okay, we have a little surprise. Nothing major.
Shauna! Cut the lights!
What do you think?
Oooh, mood lighting.
Well... kinda. We wanted to do something nice but all we could find were some color changing lights. I wish we could have done more.
I love it [g1]. Thank you for this.
Of course, now come on. Shauna's waiting on us.
I hope she's in a similar outfit.
Damn girls, you both look incredible.
Come lay down.
Hey. How did tryouts go?
About as well as they could have gone. It's hard to think about that right now though.
Thank you for setting this up for me.
You're always doing things for us, it's our turn to do things for you.
Mwah!
This will be an often thing.
You girls don't have to do this.
We want to. Now just lay there and relax.
We've also setup a TV so we can all just lay here and relax... together.
What do you want to watch?
I wouldn't mind just laying here with you two honestly.
Come on, we spent a lot of time getting it to work.
Okay, how about the news then? I haven't heard anything other than WVM all week.
It'll be nice to hear about anything else.
Sure thing baby.
I'm a little shocked.
Why's that?
We expected a fight from you.
You telling us that you don't need to relax and you wanting to get straight into moving.
Shauna's ass is amazing too. Especially in that outfit.
Both of my girls are completely sexy...
I wonder what my real mom would think about this...
Hello?
Oh sorry. I just got caught in a thought.
Do you need any help [g1]?
No! You better not get up!
I'll hold him down.
I think I got it, I'll be there in just a second...
Okay it's ready... just have to find the remote.
I think [mcf] is laying on it.
So what were you two talking about?
I was telling him that we expected him to fight back.
Well, yeah... We did.
It sounds like you girls wanted me to.
Just a little. It sounded fun to force you to relax.
To be honest with you girls I needed this.
I'm tired... Things are both the best they've ever been and the worst at the same time.
I knew coming to WVM wasn't going to be easy, I just didn't expect so many issues this quickly.
That's why it's our job to do this.
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.
Don't say that Shauna.
It's true though.
Shauna...
I think he's wearing too many clothes to relax [g1]. Want to help me fix that?
Yes I do.
Okay, not the time to bring up anything. Just relax...
Your pants are difficult [mcf].
Probably easier to take off if you use your teeth.
Haha, nice try.
There we go.
Okay, now it's time to relax.
I had something else in mind.
No, no. Not yet. First we're just going to chill.
How much time do we have?
Don't worry about that. We have plenty.
Shauna and I are still very sleepy. Do you mind if we lay our heads on your chest?
I don't mind at all.
I love you girls.
I love both of you too.
I love you both...
Now just watch some news and forget about everything else. Maybe even take a nap with us.
We'll wake you up if you have anymore... you know.
Yeah, I could probably use a nap.
And thank you for letting us do this.
Thank you for doing it. Now get some rest.
Yes baby.
Why can't this just be life. Laying in bed with two gorgeous women that care about me.
I just need to enjoy it while I can.
I wonder what's happening on the news.
You turn the TV on with the remote and change it to the local news channel.
Hello everyone! Welcome to WVM news! My name is Moon and I'll be running you through today's news.
Fuck, it's just news about WVM and I already threw the remote to the side.
Let's keep the trend going by talking about basketball first! A surprise schedule change has everyone at WVM reeling!
Our very own WVM Stars, which is led by our very own star [mcf]... they will be taking on the Briars ahead of schedule!
That's right everyone, our season opener will be the opener for the entire league! Broadcasted across the country!
Sure... it's just a preseason game but we'll get to see our new team in action!
This girl looks familiar.
If the rumors are true, we'll be seeing a lot of [mcf] in that game. You won't want to miss it!
Oh! I've just received breaking news!
There has been yet another update in our new star's love life!
Fuck me, I'm turning this off... wait, the remote.
Just have to reach around [g1] for it...
Got it... and off.
Why do people care about my love life that much?
Is there nothing else to talk about?
Damn, I think the girls are already asleep. They must still be exhausted.
I might as well join them. Not like I'm moving anytime soon.
Just need to relax... slow my breathing. Think about something random.
...
...
Hmmm...
Huh? Where am I?
Oh fuck, this is my old house. Am I in another dream?
The other ones I always felt panic. Like something awful was about to happen.
This one is different... calm.
Honey? Are you awake?
Mom?
Yeah it's me.
What happened?
You fell asleep watching cartoons. I know you don't like it when I bug you while you sleep...
You just looked so peaceful.
No, I don't mind. You can stay.
Awh honey, I should let you stay up late to watch cartoons more often.
Come here.
I love you [mcf].
I love you too mom.
Listen, we're already up way past bedtime. Let's make it worse.
Want some cereal?
Uhh, sure.
I thought you would. I'll get you some.
Thanks mom.
All the other dreams felt rushed and pieced together. This one is slow and clear.
I've never seen my mom like this. Every memory I have has always been somewhat negative.
I guess I'll follow her.
I wonder what causes me to have these dreams. Last time I slept with Shauna and [g1] I didn't have any. Or at least I don't remember having any.
Why is this so clear? It just feels like I'm living it.
Uh oh...
What is it?
I'm so sorry.
We're out of cereal... Please don't be upset.
I'll get some more in the morning I promise.
It's okay. I don't need cereal. I'm still tired.
I guess Stacy must have eaten the rest of it, that's okay.
Who is Stacy?
My sister.
Oh honey, you really are sleepy. Let's lay back down.
Uhh, okay.
Would it be too much to ask for you to sleep in Mommy's lap?
You don't have to.
Sure mom.
Ugh, it hurts seeing her try her best like this.
There must have been a lot of stress and pain in this house.
I like seeing her smile. I feel so close to her but she also feels like a stranger.
There's no doubt in my mind that she's the one I tackled last night.
I at least need to have one conversation with her. Clear all of this up.
Maybe these dreams will stop then.
Sleep well honey, we'll watch some more cartoons when you get up.
Goodnight mom. Do you want to lay down too?
No, I just want to sit here and watch you sleep. Keep you safe.
You're my baby boy. I'll never let anyone take you from me.
Mwah!
Ah, she kissed my nose. That tingled.
I love you honey, now close those eyes and go back to sleep.
...
....
Huh? What's that feeling?
It feels like...
Yep, like that.
Hey there sleepy head.
Hey.
I hope you don't mind us waking you up this way.
I don't mind. I'll actually be upset anytime I'm not waken up this way.
Haha, keep dreaming.
[g1] with her serious face again... so fucking cute.
Hey baby. How'd you sleep?
Very well. How long was I asleep?
We've all been asleep for about 2 hours. Did you have any dreams?
Damn, 2 hours. We're still the only ones here?
Yeah I did. It was a good memory though.
Want to talk about it?
Maybe, I'd like to continue what's happening here first.
I thought you might say that.
Oh, I like where this is going.
Hold on baby.
*Whispering* I talked to Shauna before we woke you up. I think she's ready.
I have to use the ladies room before we start. Yesterday was my turn, today should be hers.
You want me to make a move on her?
Yes I do.
Okay.
Mmmm, no questions asking to make sure? Good boy.
I'll be right back.
Oh, you can tell Shauna is nervous to be alone with me right now.
What's wrong Shauna?
Oh, nothing.
Nervous?
Yeah...
This isn't our first time alone like this.
Doesn't it feel like it is though?
Those other times were great... this is different. We're a couple.
It feels like the first time again. Same nerves I felt that day in my room.
We can wait some more Shauna. No need to rush back into it.
No, I want you [mcf].
Did you ever think we'd be here?
Think it? No.
Dream about it? Yes. You know I've always had a crush on you... Like a bad one.
Have you ever done this before?
You know I haven't. I've played with toys before but never anything real.
I'm just scared to make the first move.
Mwah!
I'm willing to bet you're ready.
What's that supposed to mean?
I bet you're soaking wet.
Me? Look at you!
Hard as a rock!
Oh yeah?
Oh!
[mcf]!
What? I already moved my hand away. Yours is still there.
Shut up...
What do you want to do Shauna?
Lay on your back please.
I'm willing to bet you're ready.
What's that supposed to mean?
You're as hard as a rock.
Me? Look at you!
Hard as a rock also!
Oh yeah?
Oh!
[mcf]!
What? I already moved my hand away. Yours is still there.
Shut up...
What do you want to do Shauna?
Lay on your back please.
Okay...
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm just realizing where I am right now.
There's a lot of emotions...
Shauna, come here.
On top of you?
Yes, we're not doing anything. I just want you to get closer.
Okay...
Are you ready to do this? Forget the past or anything that's telling you that you have to.
Deep down, is this what you want to do right now?
Yes... I really do.
More than anything I want to do this.
I want to be your girl in every way I can be. There's just something stopping me.
What is it?
Nerves... I go to do it then my stomach gets tight and I psych myself out.
I think I need to just do it and then I'll be fine. Like a kid first riding a bike.
Are you two...?
No, Shauna's nervous and I'm trying to let her know that everything is okay.
Awh...
What happened Shauna? I thought this is what you wanted?
It is [g1]. It really is.
*whispering* What did you tell me earlier?
I can totally hear her. She has to know that.
What did you want to be for him?
... His good girl...
What else did you say?
That I'd do anything for him, even put his needs above my own.
So what do you think you should do right now to accomplish that?
Do whatever he wants?
Mhmm, good girl. You know what he wants.
Is [g1] training Shauna?
She's not making her do anything, if anything she's helping her get what she wants. It's just a strange way to go about it.
Okay [mcf], I'm ready.
Are you sure?
Mhmmm.
Whatever [g1] is doing, it's working.
Oh fuck Shauna.
Damn Shauna, you have a really long tongue. Let me see.
Jesus... [mcf] is a lucky man.
I can agree to that. How long is your tongue babe?
Mmm, not very long.
You girls are so fucking cute. And your tongue is plenty long enough [g1].
Hehe, back to work Shauna. I want to watch.
Good girl. He really likes it when you play with the tip.
Flick your tongue around at the bottom of the head, that makes him twitch.
Oh, I can't just watch anymore. Keep it up Shauna.
Shauna looks like she wants me to say something.
You're doing great Shauna. That feels amazing.
Try to go deeper Shauna.
Seems like [g1] is getting a good show...
Oh, she's staring at me and not what Shauna is doing.
Her playing with herself while Shauna plays with me is honestly really hot.
Enjoy it baby.
She may be enjoying this more than I am. And that's saying a lot.
Oh!...
Didn't expect her to just go for it.
Damn Shauna...
Mmmm...
This is a moment I think I'll remember forever. My first time with Shauna and our first time together as a whole group.
Last night doesn't count as first since Shauna just watched.
I guess this is the norm now. Not that I'm complaining.
MMHmmm...
Ohhh! Shauna...
He..
..lp
What was that?
I think she needs help to reach the bottom.
Mhmmm.
Go ahead [mcf]. Help your good girl.
Holy...
Mmmmm...
Is she moaning [mcf]?
Mhmmm, she is.
Hold it, see how long she can hold her breath.
Mhmmm.
Okay, just tap my thigh when I need to let go.
I'll count... 1!
2!
3!...
...84!
Damn Shauna! Is she okay?
Tap, tap, tap.
*Heavy breathing* Oh damn... That was tough.
That was impressive!
Hell yeah it was.
I think it's Shauna's turn for some fun.
Climb onto [mcf]'s chest Shauna.
Okay.
Shauna is becoming way less shy about showing herself.
Like this?
That's perfect.
What are you going to do? You don't have to do anything.
Do you ever use your fingers?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Uhh, yeah... I do.
That's what I'm going to do.
Ahhhmmm!
Damn, that really got a reaction out of her.
Did that hurt?
No, god no.
I know that feeling, your entire body is reacting to him.
Mhmm..
And that's just his finger.
Want to find out what the real thing feels like?
[g1]... Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Don't you want to be his Shauna? Don't you want to give yourself to him?
Yes I do...
I want him to be my first and only.
Good. Are you ready?
I think so.
Lay on his chest. Let him hold you. I'll guide him in.
Thank you [g1].
Are you ready for him Shauna?
I love you so fucking much [mcf].
I love you too Shauna. Just tell me if I need to slow down or anything okay? Don't let me hurt you.
You could never hurt me. Just hold me... Look me in my eyes while we...
In we go...
AAAHHHmmmmmm!
Oh shit, I slid right in but you're fucking tight.
Mmmm, good girl. Give her a second to adjust to it [mcf].
No, no. I'm ready.
Are you sure? If you need a second then take it.
No. Please, fuck me [mcf].
Hard, fuck me hard.
Damn Shauna, you're surprising me. Give her what she wants [mcf].
AHHHMMM!
Holy shit [mcf]! Don't stop! Harder!
Jesus Shauna, you're amazing.
She's breathing so heavily already.
Are you okay Shauna?
Fuck yes, please don't stop!
AOOOooommmmm!!
AHHH!!!
[mcf]!!!
Holy... I can't... that's all I can take...
Did you?
Oh yeah...
I'm sorry, I didn't think I'd finish so quickly.
When you started going I couldn't control anything. My entire body is shaking.
How do you feel Shauna?
Like I'm on drugs. I'm dizzy and numb but I feel like I'm in heaven.
Okay.
Shauna is becoming way less shy about showing herself.
Like this?
That's perfect.
What are you going to do? You don't have to do anything.
Do you ever use your fingers?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Uhh, yeah... I do.
That's what I'm going to do.
Ahhhmmm!
Damn, that really got a reaction out of her.
Did that hurt?
No, god no.
I know that feeling, your entire body is reacting to him.
Mhmm..
And that's just his finger.
Want to find out what the real thing feels like?
[g1]... Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Don't you want to be his Shauna? Don't you want to give yourself to him?
Yes I do...
I want him to be my first and only.
Good. Are you ready?
I think so.
Lay on his chest. Let him hold you. I'll guide him in.
Thank you [g1].
Are you ready for him Shauna?
I love you so fucking much [mcf].
I love you too Shauna. Just tell me if I need to slow down or anything okay? Don't let me hurt you.
You could never hurt me. Just hold me... Look me in my eyes while we...
In we go...
AAAHHHmmmmmm!
Oh shit, I slid right in but you're fucking tight.
Mmmm, good girl. Give her a second to adjust to it [mcf].
No, no. I'm ready.
Are you sure? If you need a second then take it.
No. Please, fuck me [mcf].
Hard, fuck me hard.
Damn Shauna, you're surprising me. Give her what she wants [mcf].
AHHHMMM!
Holy shit [mcf]! Don't stop! Harder!
Jesus Shauna, you're amazing.
She's breathing so heavily already.
Are you okay Shauna?
Fuck yes, please don't stop!
AOOOooommmmm!!
AHHH!!!
[mcf]!!!
Holy... I can't... that's all I can take...
Did you?
Oh yeah...
I'm sorry, I didn't think I'd finish so quickly.
When you started going I couldn't control anything. My entire body is shaking.
How do you feel Shauna?
Like I'm on drugs. I'm dizzy and numb but I feel like I'm in heaven.
That was amazing.
You were amazing too Shauna.
I only lasted like 20 seconds...
You had a lot of build up. Many years of it in fact.
Getting her off that quickly was actually really hot anyway.
Can you go anymore?
I'm sorry, I need a break.
That's okay. I understand.
What about you [g1]?
I'm still just mesmerized by that.
Was it a good show?
It was really fucking hot...
Do you want a turn?
Tag! [g1]'s it!
Come on baby, you're it.
I wanted you two to have more time... but I won't say no...
Lay on your back [g1].
Like this?
Exactly like that.
Actually, slide towards the end of the bed just a little bit.
There we go. Are you ready? Need me to start slow?
No baby, just like Shauna. I want you to give it to me.
Here we go.
AHHHmmm!!
Fuck!
Give her a second [mcf].
Ahhhmmm...
[g1] was right, this is hot.
I'm ready, I'm ready. Fuck me [mcf].
Ohhhmmm...
Ohhh is right, you're rocking me too and I'm still sensitive.
I'm sorry Shauna.
I didn't say it was a bad thing.
Mmmm.... How is it baby?
I love everything about this... I love sharing this moment with you two.
Mhmmmmm... I want it to be us three forever.
Forever and ever.
Or more, just at least us three.
Mmmm.... I think Shauna's still a little too shy to ask so I will. Was she a good girl?
She was... and so are you [g1]. You're my two perfect girls.
Fuck [mcf]... Why can I never... Mmmmm....
Are you close baby?
I'm very close...
Cum on both of us. We want it.
Mhmmm...
I'm gonna... Mmmmhoooo....!!
HHHHHHNNNNNNNMMMMMMMMMGGGGGHHHH!!!!
Jesus [mcf]!
I'm about to cum too!
HNNNGG... On us baby!
Look at me [g1].
I'm looking. Please, please, please give it to me baby.
Open your mouth.
Just a few more...
I'm gonna...
AHHNNNGGggghh!!!
Oh fuck... that was a lot... I'm not done...
Jesus! How are you not done? That was so much!
It's her turn babe.
Fuck, it hurts to hold...
Oh!
Hnnnnggg!
Mmmm... It's so warm.
Don't wipe it off Shauna. Keep it.
I didn't want to wipe it off.
Like our new look?
I love it. You girls can wipe it off if you want to.
Not yet.
I have an idea.
What is it?
I've been thinking. We should start taking pictures to remember some of these memories.
Don't you think this is a memory worth remembering?
Absolutely.
Please hand me my phone babe... it's behind you.
Sure.
Say cheese!
Cheese!
Click
Oh that's a good picture.
You're so beautiful [g1].
Me? Look at your eyes!
Send that to me.
Bzz, Bzz.
Oh! [am], Rachael, and Stacy are on their way back now.
Uh oh.
It's okay, we have time to clean up still.
Do you want me to send it to you too [mcf]?
Yeah, that's definitely a memory to keep forever. Send it.
Hehe, okay.
Let me get a closer look before you girls clean up.
Fucking amazing...
It won't be the last time we look like this.
No, it definitely won't be.
Thank you [mcf].
No, thank you girls. I couldn't ask for a better thing to come home to.
Get used to it. Now let's get cleaned up. We have to move all these lights back.
Ha, true. We'll worry about that after we have some clothes on though.
I'll be right back.
Okay baby.
A few minutes and one clean up later
Oh damn, they already have everything straightened up...
Damn you girls are fast.
We just threw on some pajamas. Nothing amazing.
I disagree. You girls in pajamas is amazing.
Hehe, sit down babe.
How do you feel Shauna?
In love.
Ha, I love you too. But I meant physically... are you sore?
Tingly, really tingly. In a very good way.
So you're not in pain?
Nope, I was ready for that.
Good, now sit up here with us.
Hehe, yes sir.
Thank you girls for doing that for me. It means a lot.
[mcf]...
You deserve it... and a million other things.
What she said. And we have much more planned.
Like what?
Nuh uh, you'll find out.
We're going to be the best girlfriends we could possibly be.
You already are. I could never ask for more.
Hey... hey.
Exactly, those words exactly. 'I could never ask for more'.
That's how I've felt since our first date... and every single day without me ever asking, you give more.
So that's part of being the best, giving without being asked.
Think about it...
Ever since that day you stood up for me I was hooked on you.
You were the first person to show me that I mattered.
From that day on I weaseled my way into being your bestfriend... And now girlfriend.
I never asked for a thing... but you knew what I needed and gave it to me.
So don't ask... just let us do what we think you need.
Okay... I look forward to the surprises girls.
And we look forward to them too.
Tomorrow sounds good.
Yes it does.
Hey, it does to me too.
Hey [mcf].
Yes babe?
Should we talk about the job with Rachael?
Oh, yeah... I've been wondering what you thought about it.
Well I-
Knock, knock
That must be them.
I'll get it girls. We should talk about this with Rachael anyway.
Coming!
[mcf]!
Hey mom. How has your day been?
It's been spent thinking about you. How was your day?
It's been great actually. No need to worry right now.
Find any good furniture?
Two couches and a table. So yes.
That's all? I was expecting more.
Rachael has always been picky...
Do you have to do anything today?
A few things. Help Rachael move, go to a party tonight and I'm meant to find a therapist to talk to.
Do you have any free time for us to hang out?
I sure do mom. I'd love to spend some time with you.
Thank you...
You smell really nice mom.
Another new perfume.
It's even better than the last.
Mwah!
Oh, excuse me...
Hey Rachael.
Hey kid.
You still good to help me move this stuff in?
Sure am. But I thought it was going to be more. I even invited one of my teammates to help out.
Oh shit, I never messaged him the address...
Blame the store for having bad furniture. And hey, free team bonding exercise.
Ha, fair enough.
I'm going to go take my heels off... let me know when you're free [mcf].
I will mom, just relax some please.
I will.
Was that a kiss I saw?
Yes you saw a mom kiss her son.
Whatever you say... it was cute.
Next time just give her a little tongue.
Jesus Rachael.
Haha, I'm just saying...
Did [g1] tell you about Keyana?
No, what happened?
She showed up this morning to resign the contract. [am] was here and she was trying to talk about you.
Keyana was upset about you not being here. So it was a little chaotic for a moment.
Damn, she didn't let anything slip did she?
[g1] saved the day and got her to calm down. Told her she would let you know when she was here.
Are you two talking about the thing?
No, not yet. Shouldn't Shauna be here for the talk?
She's keeping [am] in the other room. She feels the same as I do.
Okay then. So what's up?
You have a keeper is what's up.
She's in... even got me to increase your percentage of the cut.
I think it's amazing baby.
The idea of you caring enough to make all these girls' dreams come true... you're amazing [mcf].
She does have a few things she wants...
She wants to know who the women are and when it happens.
She also wants a communication line between you three and them. So they can keep themselves and you updated on the pregnancies.
Everything else is the same?
Yep, they'll never bother you about the kids. You get them pregnant and your job is done. You're free to talk to them as much as you want to though.
You'll be getting 25 percent now. Which is a shit ton of money.
And you'll only get girls that you agree to. It's a deal that is insanely in your favor.
But it's up to you.
But our prior talks make me think you're okay with it. Right?
Yeah, let's make it happen Rachael.
Perfect.
Since [g1] and Shauna are okay with it... let's make it happen Rachael.
Perfect.
It's still a lot Rachael.
My parents weren't there for me... I don't know if I could live with myself knowing I'm the father of children I'll never see.
Are you sure? I get it... but it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.
I want to know my children Rachael. I don't think I can do it.
I thought I might could... but I can't.
I'm sorry for wasting your time.
I'm not angry. I didn't really expect to get this far with it.
We'll think of some others way to get you some money. Don't worry.
Are you really sure? I liked the idea of a bunch of little versions of you out there.
I'm sorry [g1]. I want to raise my kids.
I'll support you whatever you choose.
Just think about those women... all with dreams of having a child but for some reason they can't.
You'd be making their lives better. And who knows, maybe some of the girls would let you be in the kids' life?
I don't think I can do it babe.
That's okay... I understand. I won't try to force you into something you don't want.
You're the most selfless person alive [g1]. I love you so much.
Mwah!
Baby, all those women that want kids but can't have them for whatever reason...
You're going to change their lives forever. You're going to make them so happy and they're going to have the best kids ever.
You're amazing.
Babe, are you sure? Have you really thought about it?
There will be women carrying and having my children. Are you sure you're okay with that?
I promise it's okay if you're not. I don't want to do it if you're uncomfortable in any way.
Honestly? I think I'd be a little sad if you didn't.
I love seeing you make people happy. You're incredible at it.
Now you have an opportunity to permanently change these girls' lives. There's no negatives babe.
I'll never say no to anything like that.
And Keyana and her wife seem like lovely women.
Rachael told me you met them. Thank you for calming her down.
No problem baby, it's my part to play in this.
You're the most selfless person alive [g1]. I love you so much.
Mwah!
I love you so much too.
You two are too cute for me...
So [mcf]. Where's your friend at?
I might've forgotten to message him the address, he can be here quick though... probably.
Message him and find out.
Damien? Tell him to bring Jasmine.
I will... uhh, where's Stacy by the way?
She's outside in the truck... on the phone.
I'm going to step outside to talk to him and say hey to Stacy then.
Sounds good...
Keyana should be here soon. I'll either tell or message you when.
But [am] is here?
You'll meet Keyana in my room. [am] won't be back there. There's a way to get in through the fire escape outside.
Okay... sounds dangerous but I guess I'm down.
Don't worry. It's safe. Now go call that friend of yours.
Don't forget about Jasmine.
I won't forget. Thank you girls.
No, thank you.
Don't forget about Jasmine.
I won't forget. Thank you girls.
No, thank you.
[g1] is too good to me... she is constantly putting me and others above herself.
I'd do anything for her... and just like [am] and Shauna. I'll give her the world one day.
No matter what it takes...
...
I should go see what Stacy is doing now...
Damn, they actually got an entire box truck in this alley.
Guess Stacy is still in the front.
Muffled talking
Haha mom... stop it.
Yeah, he's nice. Really nice.
If you say so mom.
I'm sure he would...
Yeah they're nice too. I promise mom, I'm safe.
Ahem... Stacy.
Oh! You scared me!
No, not you mom... I'll call you back.
Mhmm.. I will... love you too. Bye.
Give me a second [mcf].
Hey. Sorry about that.
Hey Stacy. That was your mom?
Yep, she was just checking in on me. How did the tryouts go?
Really well. Hey, are you still down to come to Zoe's party tonight?
Uhh... about that. My mom is worried about me and wants me to video chat with her tonight. So I can't.
I would if I could though.
Oh, that's okay Stacy. It's no big deal.
Actually... if you get back here in time do you think you could say hi to her?
I told her I was living with all of you... she didn't ask to meet you but I'm sure it would help ease her mind.
Shit, that would be one hell of a way to find out if Stacy is related to me.
Uhh, sure. If I'm here I'd be more than happy to say hey to her.
Thank you [mcf].
No problem, I know what it's like to have a mom worry about you.
I'd do anything to help ease [am]'s mind.
I owe you.
Nah, you don't owe me anything. This hug is payment enough.
Oh, I told Rachael I would be inside to help her out as soon as I got off the phone.
I won't hold you here. But what does Rachael need?
She wants me to help plan her office out... where everything goes.
Oh, well good luck with that Stacy.
Haha, thank you. See you inside.
Guess it's time to call Damien.
Ring, Ring
Ring, ring, ring
Come on, pick up Damien.
Hello?
Hey Damien, it's [mcf].
Hey! What happened to that address bud?
Got a little busy, sorry about that. If you're still down to help I'll send it.
I only have to move a few couches so if you're busy it's fine.
Nah man. I'm already headed to my car. I'll be there.
Thanks man. Oh, [g1] told me to ask if you could bring Jasmine.
Uhh... she's not with me at the moment.
Oh, well that's fine. Thanks again Damien. See you soon.
See you star.
Oh, a message from Bailey.
Hey, cutie. Thinking about you. Did you talk to [g1] about me hanging out sometime?
Got a little caught up in things. Sorry Bailey. I'll ask her in just a minute. I'll see you at the party tonight.
... ding
That's okay. I know you must be busy. I'll see you tonight. <3
Don't forget. Party starts at 8pm. <3
Oh, a message from Zoe.
Party at 8pm! You better be there!
See you there Zoe.
Yes you will. ;)
Oh, Rachael just sent me a message.
Urgent! Keyana is already here. I don't suppose you saw her in the alley but she's already in my room.
Can you make it in there?
Oh shit. I guess this is happening now.
Yeah, I can make it.
Sorry for the abruptness. They didn't tell me they were on their way.
It's okay, I got this.
I know you do.
Time to head to a fire escape.
Should be this window then just a hallway to Rachael's room
Fuck, [g1] and Shauna just drained me. I hope I can still perform.
[mcf]! We finally meet again!
Come here!
You look even better than last time.
I thought I might not see you again!
Yeah, I heard about what happened. I'm sorry about that.
It's okay, it's not anyone's fault. Just a very unfortunate series of events.
So where's the mystery wife?
She had to use the ladies' room before we start.
Here... sit down. I'll go let her know you're here. She'll appreciate the heads up.
Sure. I'll be here.
Damn, was Rachael's room this kitted last night?
No way, probably just some of the other things they've gotten done already.
How much did Rachael tell [g1] and Shauna? Do they know about the other girls?
I have so many questions for them. I hope [am] doesn't get home before I can ask.
Hello?
[mcf], meet Brittany.
It's nice to meet you Brittany.
Mmm, she's short.
It's nice to meet you too.
You have amazing eyes.
Hey now, slow it down.
Hehe, thank you.
So is this really about to happen?
It really is.
Can I touch you?
You sure can.
Mmm, you're muscular.
She likes toned.
Explains how you locked her up Keyana.
I didn't give you permission to hit on my wife.
My apologies.
Do it again.
Your wife has a special aura about her.
She has a very sweet and caring attitude, she also seems like she knows how to have fun.
She also has a fierce side that makes her stand out. On top of all that she's beautiful as can be.
Well shit... do you want to just come live with us?
Haha, that's what I'm saying.
Fuck... Rachael knew what she was doing with you...
Anyway, back to business. We've set up a few rules.
What do I need to do?
Whatever we say.
Okay, what do you two have to do?
Whatever the other one says.
She decides for me and I decide for her.
Starting with what you already know. You being her first man.
Now it's her turn.
She didn't tell me that she already told you that.
Oooh, payback time then. What does she have to do?
Hmmm... Well...
She denies it but I think she's really into anal play...
Holy shit.
I guess we're just letting it all out there then. Haha
Are you against it?
Even if I was I promised her I'd do whatever she'd say.
But are you?
Hey, hey, we ask the questions here!
Final chance to back out baby. Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes! Let's do it.
That's quite the mood change from earlier.
I like him...
Damn, they actually have a very cute relationship.
They'd probably be great moms. That's really nice to know.
Fuck it... let's have a baby.
Fuck it! Let's do it!
I'll follow your lead.
Let's start it how we always do.
Mwah!
Oh, they must like to take things a little slowly.
Nevermind.
Let's show him the goods baby.
Wow...
She has huge boobs for her small frame.
Hell yeah she does. You have really nice shaped boobs as well Keyana.
Do you want to touch them?
Sure.
Hey, hey! Real quick.
I like you... but if she says stop then you better stop. Or you won't be so pretty when you leave here. Understood?
Understood. Same goes for if you say stop for her.
Good boy. Now, have fun.
Damn Brittany, these are great.
You should see them when she's bouncing around.
I hope me getting pregnant doesn't change them much.
Show him the other side baby.
Okay.
She's thick. See why we chose her to be the one to get pregnant?
You got some hips on you too Keyana. Also I thought it was because you had competitions coming up?
That too.
I think you two will make a fine baby.
Hopefully a boy.
Take off his pants babe.
Why me?
You're closer to them. I'll get his shirt.
I hope you don't disappoint here.
It doesn't feel like he will.
You better show my wife a good time. Don't forget it, you're her first man.
Were you her first woman?
Damn right I was. And I'm not one to share, so consider yourself insanely lucky.
Oh, I do.
Oh my god. It's so big...
Fuck me... honestly, just come home with us.
This is bigger than any of the toys we use.
How did Rachael find you again?
I was randomly in her office.
Fuck, talk about walking into a goldmine.
Let's get onto the bed.
Now I'm sorry. But I get first dibs on my wife. Just enjoy the show.
I can do that.
How are you feeling baby?
Excited... hot...
We should let [mcf] have some fun too.
He can wait.
At least let the poor man play with your feet.
Okay, you do get to decide what I do with him.
I'd much rather play with that ass of hers...
Brittany is staring me down. I think she really wants me to play with Keyana's feet.
Let's give it a shot.
It doesn't feel bad but Keyana isn't paying any attention to it.
If she was then this might actually be something I'm into.
HHnnnhh!!
Brittany is having fun at least.
Didn't Keyana say they were both flexible?
Yep, yes she did.
[mcf], what's wrong?
Nothing is wrong, I'm just enjoying the show.
I see you taking glances at my wife's ass. Go ahead. Pull her shorts down.
Don't have to tell me twice.
I've been wanting to see this ass for a few days now.
Damn Keyana...
She has the cutest butt doesn't she?
Cute doesn't do it justice.
You really like hitting on my wife huh?
I like hitting on both of you.
Well it's working. So I'll let you decide what happens next.
Well Keyana's ass really caught my eye.
I thought you might say that.
There's lube in my bag. Please put some on and we'll get ready.
Yes ma'am.
Are you ready baby?
Mhmmm. Ready for anything.
And it feels like he is too.
Same as you Keyana, ready for anything.
Go for it then big guy.
Fuck... that's big.
I told you... he's bigger than all of our toys.
[mcf], just go for it. This slowly pushing is worse.
Okay Keyana.
AHHNnggg!
Jesus fuck! That's so fucking big!
You asked for it baby.
Fuck... Just wait until it's your turn.
Oh, I'm waiting.
Are you good Keyana?
Yes honey, just start slow.
Heh, guess she changed her mind.
Holy shit!
Stay down baby.
Ahhhmmm... it's so big...
I know baby. How does it feel?
Big! Like it's stretching me out...
In a good way... really fucking good...
I know you... and I know you're a secret anal slut.
Baby...
You can speed up now [mcf].
Thank god, I didn't know if I could hold back from going all out for much longer.
AHHHNNGG!!
Holy fuck!
Damn [mcf]!
I'm gonna!..
Holy shit!!!
AHHNN!!
Fuck baby! I've never seen you squirm like this.
It's nnnggg.... so fucking good!
I can't take anymore... nnnnggg...
Hnnnggg...
I think she's tapping out [mcf].
Guess it's my turn.
Mmmmmm...
Damn baby... you're still gasping...
I knew you loved anal.
Haha, it was so fucking good... fuck.
I guess I do.
I wouldn't mind a turn with Keyana's pussy either. Her ass was great but that pussy looks nice too.
Doubt she could handle anymore right now though.
She looks really hot spread out like that.
Are you ready?
Are you?
Nnnggg... yes she is.
Do you want to be on top? That way you can control everything.
Thank you... yes I would.
Lay down...
Mmm... don't be nervous baby.
I'm not that nervous... I can do this.
Mmm... last reminder. You're her first. Don't fuck it up...
I'm not going to. She'll enjoy this.
You obviously did.
You little... I can't even talk properly now... fuck...
Can I start?
Go for it baby. You're both ready.
NNNNmmm.... You're... right.
I know baby, he's big. You can do this.
Here, let me help.
Oh, okay. Replacing one great view with another.
Heh, her asshole is still quivering.
It didn't take much to get her to that point either. Brittany must be right about Keyana and anal.
You got this baby. Think about why we're here.
We're doing this to have our own little child. Think about that.
Think about all the memories we'll make. But first we have to do this.
HHnnnnmmm....
Good job baby. I know it's a little painful but I also know it's not all pain.
Just hold where you are right now and the pain will go away soon. Just let your body adjust.
Even through the pain it still feels pretty good doesn't it?
Mhmmm...
Good girl, is it getting better?
Mhmmm...
Good, good. How does she feel [mcf]?
Amazing Keyana.
I knew my wife would. Lucky man.
You can start moving whenever you're ready baby.
I'm going to just start fast.
Whatever works for you.
AHHnnnggg...
Damn baby... Watching you bounce like that is really hot.
He's... so fucking big!
I know baby. Keep doing what you're doing. He'll give us a big load and we'll be that much closer to a baby.
Fuck... it feels so different.
Than a toy? Nothing can beat the real thing.
Hnnnggg...
I'm gonna...
Hold it baby... you're doing great.
I can't... I'm gonna.
AHHHNNNMMMM!!
Holy shit baby!
HHHmmggg!!
Fuck, that was a lot... especially considering I just finished with [g1] and Shauna.
Holy shit...
I told you it was good baby.
Did I do it?
Yes Brittany, you did fucking great.
Yes you did. I'm so proud of you.
Now let's let him up. Rachael said we had to be quick.
Okay baby.
Thank you [mcf]. That was great... for many reasons.
Yes it was. You'll hear from us soon okay?
Okay girls. I'm sorry for having to leave right away...
We understand. We kind of pushed our way into you today. So thank you again.
See you soon girls. Maybe we'll be a one and done.
I hope not... I mean I hope so...
Hehe, see you [mcf]. I'll call you soon.
Now put some clothes on and head out.
That went well all things considered...
They're a really cute couple. And I'm happy I'll be making them moms...
I wonder if Damien is here yet...
Guess I just wait for Damien to show up now...
Around 15 minutes pass.
Oh, there he is.
Hey there [mcf].
What's up Damien? Thanks for coming.
I told you. The flake was a one time thing. I'm trying to be your bestfriend not just your teammate.
I honestly appreciate it Damien.
And now that your current bestfriend is now your girlfriend... the position is open.
I wouldn't say that now. I still view Shauna as my bestfriend.
Well she still has some competition.
Haha, sure. She does.
So... anything new between you and Jasmine?
Ahhh, come on man. Let's not talk about her right now.
Oh... okay.
Let's sit for a second.
Now... you know I love Jasmine. I'm just stressed out and frustrated with a few things. I'd like to get away from those for a bit.
I understand Damien. I didn't mean to offend or anything.
Nah, it's not like that.
So... what should we talk about?
Whatever you want to... besides that one thing.
Hmm... Who would you say is your own bestfriend now? You and Lee seem close.
Yeah. Me and him are friends I guess.
Oh, seemed like better friends to me than an 'I guess'.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing... just that you two seemed like friends.
Mhmm...
Uhh... tell me about your past some. I don't know much about you.
What's with all the questions anyway? Can't we just have a normal conversation?
It is just a normal conversation Damien. If you don't want to talk about yourself then that's fine. Just say so.
Nah, you're just being a little weird about it.
I'm asking you very simple questions. You're the one being weird about it.
He's gotten defensive already. No point in keeping this going.
But it's whatever. Let me go tell them we're about to start moving stuff in.
[mcf] wait...
Sorry, I know you're just trying to get to know me. I'm just not good at talking about myself.
We're cool man. No need to be sorry.
[mcf], can I ask you something?
Of course you can.
Jasmine... if something happens between me and her...
Do you think she could stay with you until everything is figured out?
That's if anything happens.
I'd be happy to help in any way I can. Jasmine's a friend to all of us here. She's more than welcome anytime.
Thank you...
You didn't even have to ask Damien. You know I wouldn't say no to her if she asked.
Still... no matter what anyone says I care about that girl so damn much...
It's nice to know that she'll be okay [mcf]. Honestly thank you.
You're not planning anything are you?
No, things have just been rough.
Now let's open this truck up. We can tell them we're moving stuff in as we move it in.
Fair enough.
Damn Damien... you don't ask someone that unless you're on your last leg.
And I couldn't even ask you about your past but you can ask me if your girlfriend can stay with me.
It's not Jasmine's fault in any way. I just wish Damien was honest about everything.
If what I saw earlier is true... I can understand Damien's side. But fuck... it's going to suck when it comes out.
This is tricky to open...
Got it.
Damn, you weren't joking. Not much.
I'll climb in the back... let's get this brown couch first.
Sure thing.
You sure we shouldn't start with that table?
Nah, always start with the heavy shit and end with the easy.
If you say so.
A few minutes later
See, if we started with this we'd still have to move a couch... but now it's just the table.
I mean... we had to move the couch anyway.
But I see what you're getting at.
A few minutes later
All done! Let's do another!
Ha, that's all for today. Thanks again Damien.
No, thank you. Do you need anything else?
Nope, that's it.
Cool if I head out? There's still some things I have to do today.
Sure, I won't keep you. Just call if you ever need anything.
Same goes for you. See you at practice in the morning.
See you Damien.
That was easier than I thought it would be. But I'll probably have to help her move some more later...
At least now I get to spend some time with [am]. I miss having alone time with her.
Oh good, she's already waiting on me.
Mom.
Hey honey... are you all done?
Sure am.
Want to relax on the couch you just brought in?
I sure do.
It's been a bit since we've just talked.
It has. I've been meaning to ask you, how's the new relationship going?
It's great. Still feels strange at times but it's starting to go away.
Are you seeing any other girls?
Mom, I'm surprised you're asking that.
Rachael brought it up today, I told her that I didn't think that you were.
Why do you think that?
I've seen girls throw themselves at you since you were in middle school and you never paid them any attention.
I think it's more of the same now.
Do you really want to know?
No, not really.
I still see you as my baby boy. Even though you're twice my size now.
You've grown up so quickly... into a very handsome young man.
A handsome young man that I love to death.
I love you too mom.
You two are so cute.
Hey babe, want to cuddle with us?
No, no. I'm just passing by. I'm meant to be helping Rachael.
Just for a second... Come on.
Come on [g1]. Take a seat.
Okay...
There we go.
Man, I'm a little sleepy still.
Now is a good time to talk to [g1] about Bailey.
Hey [g1].
Yes baby?
I've been meaning to ask... that girl Bailey.
What about her?
Is it cool if she hangs out with us sometime? Not today, but just whenever.
That's fine with me. You should also ask Shauna just to make sure.
I will. Thank you [g1].
Anything for you baby.
Hmm, I should tell her about her sister and Willow too.
Hmm, now is a good time to tell [g1] about her sister and Willow too.
Hey [g1].
Yes baby?
I should tell you. I gave Willow a ride today... she was walking barefoot on the street at 5am. She looked lost.
I also checked on her when I got out of practice. Nothing happened. Well she kissed me on my cheek but it was nothing.
I just wanted you to know that.
That was very sweet of you baby. Thanks for telling me.
Did she say why she was out there?
No, I couldn't get her to.
And I think your sister is staying with her right now.
I don't want to talk about her right now baby...
I understand. I just wanted to let you know that she's safe.
Thank you.
Are you comfortable babe?
How could she not be? Have you seen her butt? Big ol' cushion.
Haha, says queen butt! Yours is bigger than mine!
It's not even close.
Stand up, let [mcf] decide.
No, that's a little weird... right?
It's only weird if you make it weird.
What [g1] said. If you call someone out then you have to back it up.
Are you sure? I'm your mom...
It's a fully clothed butt. It's no big deal unless you make it one.
Uhh... okay...
What do I do?
Just lean onto the couch. It'll be quick, don't worry.
Okay...
Hers is bigger right?
Uhh... it's actually hard to tell.
[am]'s butt is bigger than I thought it was... huh.
They're both big, but in different ways.
Uhh... what did I just walk into?
Butt competition. Want to join?
I don't think I'd win unless it's for smallest.
It actually is.
Then sure.
Built like a paper towel roll.
Ha, small can be cute too Stacy. But yeah, you win.
Win what?
Butt competition. Don't think you'll win Shauna.
I think Stacy has you beat. Want to compete against [g1] and [am]?
I mean, sure?
Same as before honestly. All big but in different ways.
Yeah, hard to pick a winner.
Actually... the winner is [mcf]. Two of them are his girlfriends and one is his mom. That's luck right there.
Ha, true.
Where did everyone go?
Uhh... butt competition.
Really? Stealing my help so you can look at butts?
Live a little Rachael.
Oh, I can live kid. Butt competition huh?
Who wins?
Damn Rachael. Not afraid to air it out in front of everyone.
Okay, okay. That's enough. Let's put our butts away.
Yeah, Stacy wins anyway. I don't want to try and sort out the others.
What do I win?
Bragging rights?
On being the most stick like? Awesome.
Okay, competition is over. Can I have my help back?
Yes you may.
Hehe, didn't mean for that to turn into an entire thing.
It was funny though.
Now just relax and spend some time with [am]. We'll handle everything else.
Thank you girls.
Everything okay mom?
Sorry if that was too far. I'm used to [g1] playing around like that...
What? No, I'm okay. Rachael just went a little too far.
Yeah, I wasn't expecting that.
Can I ask you something? It's kind of random.
Anything.
If that was your mom last night... are you going to find her?
Oh... I...
Yeah, I have to. I have to at least talk to her once. Ask her about my sister.
You should... find her [mcf].
You deserve to know your real mom.
Can I ask one more question?
Yeah, of course.
What is your future going to be like? Am I in it?
I know you're going to get married... have kids... all that.
Usually people don't include their moms in those plans.
Mom, stop talking crazy.
I've told you this before... I'm going to get through this year.
If everything goes as planned then I'll pledge for the draft... where I'll hopefully be picked early on.
We'll get a nice house in whatever city I get drafted to.
Yeah I want to get married and have kids... that's true.
But Shauna and [g1] both love you. You're a mom to them too. Plus we'll have a built in babysitter.
And I'll give you whatever you want. You deserve it.
All I want is to stay with you [mcf]. Doesn't matter where... I don't care about things or places. I just want to see you live the life that you deserve.
Mwah!
These kisses are getting stronger each time...
You'll get much more than that mom.
Now let's cuddle up and just talk some more... okay?
Yes please.
Many conversations and cuddling later...
And an accidental nap later
Oh, he's waking up.
Hey Shauna...
Tired huh?
Yeah, I guess we were.
What time is it?
A little after 8. Stacy and Rachael just left to get us all food.
Oh... oh fuck. The party was meant to start at 8.
It's okay baby... it's just a party.
I promised Zoe I would be there.
She'll be okay. You can rest if you want to. That's what today is about.
I should really go [g1]. I don't think she'd let me live it down all year.
And I'd feel pretty bad about flaking on her.
I'm going to slide out from under [am].
Are you girls going?
And leave [am] to wake up all alone?
Oh...
It's okay babe. Me and Shauna will stay. Go enjoy your party.
Yeah, we'll stay here and keep [am] company. Plus we have food on the way.
We'll put yours up for later.
Thank you girls.
Anything for you.
Mhmmm.
Mwah!
Mwah!
Enjoy the party [mcf]. We'll be here waiting on you.
If we are asleep when you get here then don't be afraid to snuggle up with us.
I won't girls. I'll be home soon. I love you both.
I love you too.
And I love you as well.
Bye girls.
Fuck... just remembered I don't have my car anymore either. Time to take a bus.
One bus ride later
Uhh... this doesn't look like a party...
Where is everyone?
Yesterday she said the party would be in here. Guess I'll just wait for a minute.
Knock, knock.
Oh, that was quick at least.
Hello? Zoe? Emiko?
Hey Kimmy.
[mcf]? What are you doing here?
Zoe invited me. I don't know where they are.
So you just invited yourself in to sneak around in their room?
I was just sitting on the bed waiting Kimmy.
...
Fuck... guess we're both waiting.
There's another bed over there. Don't sit next to me.
In fact you can even go home if you'd like.
Nah, I'm going to sit here.
Fine.
Kimmy. We've never had a conversation and you hate my guts. Can we talk about that?
No.
It's fucking petty. We have the same friends. We're going to run into eachother a lot. Do you really want to go through this everytime?
...
We're both here. We can talk about this. We can figure something out. You don't have to like me. But I don't want you to hate me.
I'm not here to ruin your life. I'm here trying to better my own.
I have a family I'm trying to take care of Kimmy. That's all I care about.
So I'm sorry if I come off as rude but see it through my eyes.
...
I'm here so I can make it to the league so I can financially support my mom and my girls for the rest of our lives.
So when there's just a girl who hates me and won't even tell me why... you can see how that pales in comparison.
You're taking care of your mom?
Adoptive mom. I don't know my real parents.
Are they alive?
My dad isn't. I think my mom is.
I have adoptive parents too.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that Kimmy.
Do you even know what happened?
I can't say I do Kimmy.
I came to this shitty school for the same reasons as you. I'm a swimmer.
That's why this school has like four swimming pools. I was basically you before you came along.
So let me ask you. If suddenly there was someone else that came along and took all these things away that the school is giving you how would you feel?
Probably not great, I never came here for any special benefits though.
This was the closest college that accepted my bestfriend Shauna. It also accepted my girlfriend's sister Elizabeth.
... does your family live with you?
They did... but I was kicked out of where I was living. So they moved back home.
Where did you live?
That green house that you call home now.
Oh no, Kimmy. We have to talk about that. You don't under-
Woah! Not on my bed you two!
Get a room! Well... a different room!
Ughhh...
Bye Zoe.
Kimmy... come on. I was just joking.
...
Shit, I didn't mean to make her leave.
I really needed to talk to her Zoe.
She's not going anywhere. She'll stay for the party.
And hey...
You actually came!
Yeah, I'm sorry I was late.
You're not late for the party.
Sit down.
Party was at 8 right?
It's almost 9 now.
Party is at 9... and parties don't really have set times dude.
Why was I told 8?
So you got here early.
Oh...
Mhmmm.
So... do you see that bruise on my thigh?
What bruise?
Haha! Got you!
Hmmm... Zoe...
Hey, no talking.
I mean, worse pranks have been pulled on me.
Haha! Your face is so red!
Oh yeah?
Can't really do the same thing to her... Maybe a simple kiss out of nowhere will do.
Mwah!
[mcf]!
Damn Zoe... you said my face was red.
Uhh... is everything okay?
Yeah... I didn't say you could do that.
I didn't say you could motorboat me.
Come here.
Are you telling me the great Zoe can be rocked by a little kiss?
Shut up...
Haha, so it's true.
I said shut up...
Haha, okay. We're even now.
And I can totally kiss without getting rocked.
You just sneak attacked me.
Watch.
Mwah!
Woah guys... get a room.
Oh, hey Emiko.
She stole my joke.
Should I storm out now?
Haha, what's a party without a little drama?
Let me say hey to Emiko.
Come on Zoe. I'm not in the mood for pranks right now.
Party pooper at an actual party. How sad...
Woah guys... get a room.
That was my joke!
Hey Emiko.
Your little bump is looking better today Emiko.
Thank you [mcf]. I'm sorry I wasn't at tryouts.
Don't worry about it. You have all year to cheer me on.
And I will. Thanks for coming tonight.
I wouldn't miss it.
Emiko looks really nice in that dress.
What happened to your nose Emiko?
She's clumsy.
I slipped and hit a corner on our desk.
Oh damn, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
And thanks for coming tonight.
Of course.
Knock, knock.
Can you get that [mcf]?
Sure.
Coming!
[mcf]!
Bailey! And Rainn?
Hey.
Hi...
Damn, she looks so different without all the makeup on.
Give me a hug [mcf].
Come here then.
Mmmm..
*Whispering* I missed you.
I missed you too.
Bailey has tiny arms but she gives great hugs...
Doesn't look like Rainn likes me hugging her though.
I'm glad you're here.
I am too. Not really what I expected when I heard party though.
Party isn't in here. It's in the other room.
I'm going to say hey to Zoe real quick.
Okay, I'll talk to Rainn for a moment.
Rainn? You okay?
Huh? Yeah... I'm fine.
Can I help you?
I just wanted to talk for a second.
Oh... My bad.
What's up?
I just wanted to say I really like the no makeup look. You look a lot sweeter this way.
Thank you. I usually don't go out without anything on but... I felt like relaxing tonight.
You should relax more often.
Noted. Thank you.
So how's everything? How's the diner going?
Going well... Haven't seen you around anymore though.
I will be. Don't worry.
I'll take your word for it.
So Rainn. You're cool with me and Bailey being a thing right?
Why wouldn't I be?
I saw that little look when I hugged her. I just want to make sure.
Oh... no, you misunderstood. It's just everything me and her have went through. I'm worried for her.
What do you mean?
She hasn't told you anything?
No, not really. Nothing that matches anything that you're talking about.
I shouldn't say much then... just that-
Hey, hey... [mcf].
Uhh... ready to party?
Sure?
Let's go then. Let's get out of here.
Huh, so it's actually Bailey hiding something... not Rainn.
A party isn't the time to bring this stuff up though... I'll let it slide tonight.
I'm sure she has a good reason for it.
All right, let's go.
It's just right down the hall.
Hey, hey. [mcf].
Ready to party?
Uhh.. sure. We going now?
Why not? Mostly everyone is here.
Yeah, let's go ahead and head over.
It's just right down the hall.
What about Kimmy?
She knows about the party room. It's not what it used to be but she knows that's where we're going.
Okay... let's go then.
Just follow us, we're heading back into WVM.
We're allowed to do that?
No, but I have keys to get in and we won't get in trouble... so follow us.
Fair enough, lead the way.
Party room? Sounds interesting...
I wonder if Natalie knows about it...
Shhhh...
What the?
Shhh... turn around.
Stay quiet, the girls will head there without us.
There's something I want to show you.
What about the keys?
I already gave them to Emiko.
Now come on. We don't have a ton of time.
Zoe...
Less talking, more walking.
Fuck... okay.
There's no way the other girls don't notice, I don't think they'd mind though.
[mcf]?
Where are you two going?
Zoe said she wants to show me something... you girls go ahead. We'll be there in a minute.
What is she showing you?
I don't know, she just told me to follow her.
Oh... well, have fun. We'll wait on you.
We won't be long...
Come on [mcf].
A few moments later
Okay, good. We're finally alone.
You wanted to show me a classroom?
What? No?
Ever since you showed up here at WVM I've had to hear other girls talk about you.
All the nice things you've done and how you're helping them out... Where's mine?
You seem like a girl that has everything in order Zoe.
Hmm, fair enough... but these are what I wanted to show you.
Damn Zoe...
I like them, they're better than a classroom right?
Much better.
Remember that little shake I teased you with earlier? I bet it would be better without my top on.
Definitely feels better to do.
Fuck Zoe, you have great tits.
Just now noticing?
I have too much competition here...
So there.
Am I worthy of the great [mcf]?
Hmmm, is the back as good as the front?
Asshole, of course it is.
You've seen my girlfriends, they have great asses.
Hey, I'm not trying to be another girlfriend. But so do I.
Mhmmm, prove it then.
Fine.
Mmmmmm-wah!
Damn Zoe...
Who is rocked from a kiss now?
I'll play along with Zoe.
The kiss was okay, that ass on the other hand... I've seen better.
Mmmhmmmm. Sure you have. Need a better look or just an eye surgeon?
Let's start with a better look.
Here, now you may bask in the beauty of my ass.
It's okay.
Just okay? Get closer.
Amazed yet?
Hmmmmm...
What about now?
There's just something missing.
What's that?
Hold on, I'm enjoying this.
So you do like it?
Maybe, let's find out.
Oh! I said look not touch.
Do you want me to stop?
...
You can pull it down...
There we go...
Like it?
It's cute.
Cute? That's not what I was going for.
You can touch it...
I'm going to go for something else.
Oh! I didn't mean my tits.
You should be more specific then.
Most guys would be nicer to a girl that is fully naked in front of them.
I don't think I'd be in this room with you if I was most guys.
Good point. You wouldn't be.
[mcf]... you have really pretty eyes.
Woah, a compliment. So do you Zoe.
Mwah!
Uhmmm... I'm naked and you still have all your clothes on.
We can fix that.
Hehe, yes we can.
Can I call yours cute too?
I'd be flattered.
I might be taking off your pants but you have to take off your own shirt.
I'll take that deal.
Fuck [mcf]. It looks even better than last time.
Fuck [mcf]...
Is it cute?
Yeah, you could say that.
Can I... put my mouth on it?
Yes you can.
Mmm, Zoe's cherry red lips... I'm playing with her but fuck, she's gorgeous.
I wonder if she can go as far as Shauna.
That feels great Zoe, keep going.
Mmmnnggg*gag*uhhhhh...
Oh, damn. She's already struggling. She must have a sensitive gag reflex.
Don't laugh at me.
What? I'm not laughing. You were doing great.
No I wasn't.
You don't have to go deep for it to feel good. I prefer it when girls focus on the head anyway.
But let's switch it up. Stand up.
Was it that bad?
No, it really wasn't.
For some reason I just assumed Zoe would be great at all of this.
I especially didn't expect her to be insecure.
I just want to try something else. Take a seat on that desk.
Okay...
Now what?
Slide your cute bits to the edge of the desk.
You really do have a great body Zoe.
Thought it was just 'cute'?
I mean it is cute. It's more than that though.
Can I?
Mhmmm.
Ahhhmm...
Woah, that's different. I'm used to the feeling of being pushed out but she feels like she's pulling me in.
Mmm, keep going [mcf].
You can do another finger.
There's the Zoe I know.
Ahhhmmm! Fuck!
Fuck is right, she's squeezing the shit out of my fingers.
Fuck! That feels so..
So what? Good?
I mean, it's okay...
Not painful?
No, not at all.
Can you use your mouth too?
I don't even need to answer that.
OH! AMMMHHHnnnnnnmmm!!
Oh fuck, she's already squirming. She must really-
AHHHnnnn!!
Damn Zoe...
Just okay huh?
Holy... yeah, it was all right.
This girl...
Are you done?
No, not even close.
Flip around and get on your knees then.
She has a really cute butt.
Her pussy probably needs a little break...
There's another hole I can play with though.
Oh! [mcf]!
That feels...
Ahhmmm!
She's still sensitive so this is probably a pretty weird feeling for her.
[mcf]...
Feels good right?
Uhhh...
Fuck, she's going to make my competitive side come out with this.
Admit it Zoe.
...
I might end up regretting this...
Hey Zoe. Prepare yourself.
What do you mean?
Aah! What is that?
Haha, it's just a pen that was on the desk.
Why?
You were acting like my tongue wasn't enough. Figured you might need something more.
Ha, well it's doing more for me than your tongue was.
Mhmm, we'll see about that. Put your feet back on the floor and bend over the desk Zoe.
Mmmm, all of her teasing has me fucking ready.
She already showed me that it doesn't take much to get her off... I wonder how she can handle actual sex.
Are you ready Zoe?
Mhmm.
Just don't cum inside me.
Fuck... she's tight but I'm sliding right in without resistance.
If I go any more I'm going to push the pen further into her.
Mmmm...
That little moan isn't enough for me.
AHHmmmmmnnn!
There we go.
Mmmm... nnnhhhmmmm...
How is it Zoe?
Hmmmnnn... it's okay.
Mhmm, if you're going to lie then you should at least try to moan less.
Hmmm... Nnnnnn....
I'm going to start her out slow...
Fuck... It's...
Ready to admit it yet Zoe?
Nnn... It almost feels as good... Mmm... as my hand.
Mhmmm, I'm sure.
Fuck... MMMnnNN...
Hooolyyyy.... NNnnnnnnaaaaaa......
Okay... Mmm... It's pretty good...
That's not good enough for me Zoe.
Mmmm...
Ahh!! MMmmnnnnnaa!!
Fuck... her pussy feels amazing... the faster I go the more her muscles force me back inside of her.
I want to make her cum again... if I can last that long.
Fuck! Fuck! Ahhhhhmmmmnnngggg!!
AHHNNNNGGGGGGHHH!!!
Oh shit Zoe... I'm fucking close.
Fuck, she's kicking around... I have to climb up to stabilize her.
Fuck [mcf]... I don't... mmmm....
I'm almost done Zoe.
Just a few more quick thrusts...
AHHHNNNMMM!!
Fuck!!
You feel so fucking good Zoe...
I'm so close... Just a few more...
HHHNNNGGGHH!!!
AHHHHNN... fuck!
Oh fuck!
HHHHMMM!!
Fuck me she leaned too far into the chair.
As I was going to pull out she started to fall and I only halfway pulled out.
Fuck...
Zoe? Are you okay?
Hmmmm... Yeah...
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you fall.
Where did the pen go?
Fuck [mcf]...
Hold on, I'm climbing down.
Did you cum inside me? I feel it running on my leg.
Kinda... I was going to pull out but you lost your balance and I got stuck between doing that and trying to save you from falling.
Fuck... okay. It should be fine.
So? Still only almost as good as your hand?
Shut up.
Mwah!
You know I wasn't being serious. It was just fun to watch you try to one up yourself.
It worked. That was... intense.
You're telling me...
How many times did you? Four right?
Maybe... After the second one it felt like it never stopped.
Is sex always like that?
I mean... for you?
I'm just saying... I can hardly catch my breath right now.
It can be but no, not always. This was definitely pretty special.
I agree.
We should probably get back to the girls. They've been waiting for a bit.
True...
Do you think they know what we've been doing?
Anyone with a brain knows what we were doing [mcf].
You have practice in the morning right?
As always. Why?
We need to talk about some things. But I want to sleep on them tonight before we talk about them.
Oh... okay. Sure.
Good, now let's get dressed.
A few moments later
You all good?
Yep. What about you? Can you walk?
Walking isn't an issue. Sitting will be though.
Sorry about that.
Don't be. I'd do it again.
I mean?
Soon, come on.
Hey girls.
There you guys are.
We waited on you. Can you go down first?
Sure? Why?
On the off chance there's a murderer down there.
Be our savior.
Haha, sure. I'll be the sacrifical lamb.
Hmm, no questions about me and Zoe? That's surprising.
Though they may just respect Zoe enough to not ask.
We shouldn't Zoe. Let's just focus on the party.
Hmmm... Fine...
This the room?
Yup.
Can you go down first?
Sure? Why?
On the off chance there's a murderer down there.
Be our savior.
Haha, sure. I'll be the sacrifical lamb.
Huh, not what I expected.
Everything's clear!
Coming!
Like the room?
Lighting is cool, room is pretty bland though.
That's because they took everything away. We still use it though. There's a nice couch.
Hey, I'm just here to hang out so it's cool with me.
What are you going to do [mcf]?
What do you mean?
Like... do you want to play any games or anything?
Uhh sure. I'm down.
We should let everyone get here first.
Who all is left?
I think Penelope, Natalie, and Kimmy.
You girls go ahead and take a seat. I'll stand by the door so they know we're down here.
That's kind of you.
Yeah, thank you [mcf].
Not the party I had in mind but honestly I prefer this.
No alcohol or anything though? That's strange.
[mcf]?
Hey there Penelope. How have you been?
I've been good. Could you help me?
Sure? What do you need me to do?
Help me lift this cooler down these stairs...
Oh yeah, I can help with that.
Thank you.
A few moments later
Phew, it's heavy.
How many do you have in there?
I don't know. I just grabbed a few from the diner.
They sell alcohol at the diner?
It's not on the menu but those that ask do.
Ha, fair enough.
Oh, that's more than 'a few'.
I didn't know how many we'd need. You can grab one if you'd like.
Nah, I don't drink. Thank you though.
Oh, sorry. I didn't know that.
It's fine. I'm not against it or anything I just have practice early tomorrow and shouldn't drink tonight.
Do you mind if I do?
Not at all. Go for it.
I'm going to keep waiting at the door for Natalie and Kimmy.
Okay, I'll be over here.
Penelope looked nice. I like her hair more when it's not behind her ears.
Oh, I think I hear footsteps.
[mcf]!
Hey Natalie. You're looking great.
Thank you very much. You're looking very handsome yourself.
Can I ask you something a little embarrassing?
What is it?
Would you mind talking to my mom for a moment? She's upstairs.
Sure. What do you need me to say?
Just that you'll make sure I'm safe and all that. I'm sorry. She's making me ask.
Haha, it's fine Natalie. I'll go talk to her. You go ahead and get comfy.
Thank you very much.
A few minutes later.
[mcf]!
Hey Harp.
Come over here.
I'm sorry for interrupting your party.
It's fine. I like talking to you Harp.
Did Natalie tell you why I told you to come up here?
Pretty much...
Sit for a second please.
I promise you I don't like being the controlling mom but I can't help it.
I understand.
Is there a curfew or anything? It is a school night.
I mean, if you don't mind bringing her home then she can stay out a little late.
Hmm, that car is here. I could get it to take Natalie home.
Yeah I can bring her home.
You keep her safe. I'm trusting you on this. Also, no alcohol.
She's like her mom, she can't handle it.
Promise, neither one of us will drink any tonight.
Thank you. And before I let you go. Can I ask something?
Of course Harp.
Uhhh... not sure how to say it...
Just say whatever is on your mind.
How fucked are we?
Uhh?
I'm excited for this season. But I can't shake this feeling of dread. Like I'm going to fail and embarrass myself again.
Last year there weren't any expectations and I still let people down.
This year there's nothing but expectations...
There's even expectations from you... I don't want to let you down.
We're still scrapping together a team a week before the season starts...
I think it's easy to fall into the 'must win' mindset right now.
Our focus shouldn't be on that though. It should be on getting our team in order. Everyone is either all in or they're out.
The media is going to buzz. Our names will be talked about a lot. None of that matters though.
I didn't 'choose' you as my coach because I thought it'd be the easiest pathway to success.
I chose you because I could see there was a fire to win, to prove everyone wrong.
I can tell you care. You're here for more than a paycheck, just like me.
Really? You can see that?
Yeah, absolutely. Admittedly there's a lot of room to grow... for both of us.
And there's going to be growing pains. But I've got your back and you've got mine.
There's no reason we can't do this Harp.
Damn, she's squeezing my leg pretty hard.
I really needed to hear that [mcf]. Thank you.
This might sound strange but you remind me a lot of my mom [am]. Strong and caring.
That's about the best compliment I could give someone.
Thank you [mcf]. I'll get out of your hair now.
I know Veronica said you had to stay late tomorrow but... are you free after that?
I should be. Will you still be at the school around that time?
I think I will be.
Well I'll find you and let you know after I get done with everything.
Perfect. I hope you have fun tonight.
Thank you Harper. I'll have Natalie home soon. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
As dysfunctional as everything has been here... I don't think much of it has been caused by Harper.
She has a lot to learn but I think she's capable. It's going to be a tough year for both of us.
I should get back downstairs...
Oh, hey Zoe. What are you doing?
Seeing where you went.
Miss me already?
What if I did?
Then that would be cool with me.
Can you still not sit down?
Haven't tried. Don't think I will anytime soon either.
Still worth it?
Without a doubt.
What for?
This party kind of lives and dies with you.
I think you just missed me.
Keep flattering yourself.
I will.
Hey [mcf]. Where'd you go?
Had to talk to my coach for a second. I need to take Natalie home tonight. Where is she?
She's on the couch talking to the other girls.
Are you busy right now?
Nope, free as a bird.
Can we sit down?
That's my cue to head back to the other girls.
Sure Penny.
So what's up?
Nothing really. It just feels good to be here.
I'm sorry if I bug you or it feels like I'm trying to force my way into your life.
What? You're just being friendly Penny. I don't mind at all.
Good, good. It's just... ever since I went through a bunch of your interviews I felt like I should get to know you.
In a weird way it feels like I do... and that's weird because you barely know anything about me.
Well I'd like to learn more.
Like what?
Start from the beginning. We have a whole party.
Oh, I don't know. That's not a great idea.
Why?
Bad memories and things that shouldn't be talked about at a party.
Oh, fair I guess. If you ever feel like talking about it then I'm all ears though.
She has nice legs... I hadn't really noticed before.
[mcf]?
What are you looking at?
Oh... sorry. I was just thinking that your legs look nice in that outfit.
Oh... wow. Thank you.
Why are you two hiding over here?
Hey there Bailey.
Hey...
Have you been drinking?
Not much... want to play a game now?
What did you have in mind?
You two ever play 'Never have I ever'? Emiko wanted to play it.
I don't think I have.
It's fun. I'll explain as we go. It's simple.
What are we waiting for?
Damn, Emiko is drinking too. For some reason I thought she'd be the type to not drink.
We're coming. Have we asked the other girls if they'd like to play?
They said no but you can try.
I'll be right back.
Good, no drink in Natalie's hand.
Hey girls.
What's up?
Emiko said she already asked but I'm just making sure...
You girls sure you don't want to play whatever game Bailey was talking about?
I'd like to but...
But me and her are having a very important conversation right now.
Oh okay. I won't get in your two's way.
What about you Rainn?
...
Rainn?
Huh? Sorry. I was in my thoughts.
You're good, I was just making sure you didn't want to play whatever game we're about to play.
No thank you, I just want to chill on this couch for a bit.
Oh okay. We'll be over there if you girls need us.
Noted.
No one huh?
Nope. So how do I play?
Everyone puts a hand up. We each use four fingers.
We'll go in order and each one of us will say something we've never done.
If anyone here has done it. They have to put a finger down. And we go until someone is out.
Sounds simple enough. What happens to the loser?
Hmmm...
They have to do a lap around the school naked.
Haha, I'm down.
Uhhh... okay.
Then we can start. Who wants to go first?
You go first Penelope. I need to grab another drink.
How is this going to work?
You three keep going. I'll put my fingers down if I hear anything I've done. You guys need an advantage against me anyways.
Okay... uhhh...
Never have I ever had a threesome.
Nope.
Come on, you know I have two girlfriends.
I didn't know you had threesomes with them... but good for Shauna.
It's your turn [mcf].
Uhhh... Never have I ever put something in my butt.
Fuck.
Yep, same.
I mean, everyone's at least tried it before.
Hmmm... 
Never have I ever masturbated and thought about a celebrity.
Got me.
Me too.
Oh! Details!
I really shouldn't...
I will, it was sometime a few years ago, I was home alone. A movie I was watching showed a boob for like two seconds.
So I then spent the next half hour trying to find the perfect frame of the boob.
You know there's websites for that stuff right?
Ehh, I grew up poor. I took whatever I was given and that just happened to be a very blurry boob.
All right Penny, your turn.
Hmm... Never have I ever had sex with a man.
That's a no from me.
Same...
Hmmm... Bailey's actually a virgin? And so is Penny? Damn.
Let's not linger on this one. Go ahead [mcf].
I think I have a good one.
Never have I ever taken a nude picture of myself.
Fuck...
Yeah, fuck...
Oh wow, stories?
Nothing interesting. Took some pictures just to see what some things looked like from different angles. Never sent them.
Ahh, fair. Everything okay Penny?
It's just a long story...
Uhh, I was pretty self conscious growing up and there was a blog where people would post their bodies and people would say nice things.
Like everyone got nice things said about them. No matter what.
I put a picture of just my back and butt and not a single person liked or commented on it.
Damn Penny. Are you sure it actually uploaded?
I checked on my phone, laptop, and everything. It was up.
There's plenty of nice things to say. That's awful.
Thank you [mcf].
Damn, I can see how that could rock someone's confidence.
Can we get back to the game? I might be showing this body off if it keeps going like this.
Yeah, sure.
Your turn Bailey.
Uhh... Never have I ever broken a bone... sorry I'm out of good ones.
I haven't... surprisingly.
Me neither...
Penelope with the comeback chance.
I just have to get one of you then survive. I have a pretty cheap one. Sorry guys.
Never have I ever been on an actual date.
Oh fuck...
And we're all down to one.
I could cater an answer to knock one of you out.
Oh no...
I got one!
Zoe just reminded me of a great one. Never have I ever watched porn.
Well fuck.
She fucking boomed us.
Haha... shit.
So who first?
We can all go at the same time.
But really? Never watched porn?
Parents blocked all of the sites. I tried to though.
Well... let's get this over with girls.
Nervous at all?
Yes...
Only a little.
Easiest way to do this is to just do it.
Sound advice.
Let's do it then.
I'm just happy I'm not doing this alone.
We're both right here. We're all going through this together. And I'll keep my eyes up.
Okay...
So just a lap around the school? Back to here?
Yep. All at once or take turns?
I need to be careful to not get an erection right now. That'd make things a little more awkward.
[mcf]?
Huh?
Are we taking turns or going together?
That's up to you girls.
Well I say take turns! Me first!
See you soon Bailey.
Guess it's just us now.
Yep, that's cool right?
Yeah of course. I like Bailey but I'm more comfortable around you.
And... you can look if you want to...
You sure?
Mhmmm... you said there were nice things to say.
There's not a single thing wrong with your body Penny. You have nice legs, a tight stomach with good hips, and cute nipples.
Oh... [mcf].
That's... that was very kind. Thank you.
No problem Penny. And I'm being honest.
There's not a single thing wrong with your body Penny. You have nice legs, a tight stomach with good hips, and cute nipples.
Oh... [mcf].
That's... that was very kind. Thank you.
No problem Penny. And I'm being honest.
I shouldn't Penny. Maybe in a different scenario but us both being naked in a hallway isn't really where my head needs to be at.
Oh, no. I understand. That makes sense.
Fuck... this is a little awkward now.
I hope Bailey hurries up.
Almost there!
Done! My run of shame is complete.
Good job Bailey.
So... who is next?
Uhh...
Fuck it, I'll go next.
That's the spirit.
I'll beat your time too Bailey.
I'll be timing you! Go!
This should probably feel worse than it does.
Part of this makes me feel free.
This might be the most stress reducing thing I've done all week.
Oh my god!
Oh fuck! I'm sorry Lauren. I didn't know anyone was here.
I heard someone running around so I came to check...
Haha, get in the lounge and cover up.
Oh, I thought you'd be pissed.
I've had enough bullshit tonight. This is just funny now. Get inside.
Lose a bet or something?
Yeah, something like that. Am I in trouble?
You got lucky. You caught me on a night where I want shit to go poorly.
What do you mean?
Uhh, you should cover up before we keep talking.
With what?
Here, use my shirt. I have on my gym bra so it doesn't matter.
Now have a seat on the couch.
Thanks Lauren.
No problem.
So what's got you so worked up?
Charles randomly leaving at the start of the year and leaving me to figure shit out myself.
I think I might quit.
But I'm not worried about me... I've been meaning to talk to you for a few days.
This isn't how I envisioned it going but this is more entertaining.
I just wanted to ask how you're handling everything.
Decently. Things could be better but they could also be way worse.
What I've heard is there's a lot of people putting weight on your shoulders. Are you not stressed out?
At times. But I'm lucky enough to have a great people at home who help me in everyway they can.
That's good, really good. I'm sorry for getting personal.
I ran into you while I was completely naked. We started this pretty personal.
Ha, true. I took a few years of psychology and I'm thinking of pursuing something with it.
You're an interesting person to me.
Thanks?
Would you be interested in another chat? One where we both have more clothes on.
I think I could learn a lot from you.
Yeah sure. I guess I'm cool with that.
Great! But you should really go get your clothes back on.
Do you need your shirt back?
Nah, keep it. No one else will have to see my belly fat.
You have a perfectly fine body Lauren... Don't say things like that.
Thank you...
You really shouldn't say those things to me when you're nude though.
Oh, my bad Lauren. I see how that might come off weird.
In all honesty I'm probably a little too sensitive about it... it's just after the scandals last year...
You've mentioned those. What exactly happened?
A teacher caught sleeping with a student. Was a whole power dynamic thing.
Neither the student or the teacher are here anymore but that shit almost knocked WVM off the map.
So we do everything we can to avoid it. The smallest thing will be picked up by the media.
I understand... so I really shouldn't be talking to you while in my birthday suit.
No, you really shouldn't.
I'll see you tomorrow [mcf].
See you Lauren. And thanks for the warning.
Mhmmm.
All things considered that was lucky.
Lauren could've done a lot worse to me.
I wonder if Penny and Bailey are still there waiting on me.
Hmmm, nope. Their clothes are gone too so they must've gotten dressed and went back down.
Luckily my clothes are still here.
I was wrong about the stress thing, that was a little stressful.
And I was told to get an actual therapist and I got Lauren who hopes to maybe be one. Close enough?
Anyway, let's see what the girls are doing.
Oh... What happened?
There you are! Rainn, Bailey, and Penelope are looking for you.
Lauren caught me. I was in the lounge with her. What happened to Emiko and Natalie?
They both drank too much.
Fuck... I fucked up.
Natalie? You awake?
Yuuu.... yup. Inni donnaaa wanna sleepyyyy...
How much did you drink?
Two beers.
Harper wasn't lying.
Your mom is going to kill me Natalie...
Noooo... no. Sh... she think you cute... haha
Fuck... do I take her home like this?
What happened?
I wasn't supposed to let her drink any. Harper told me not to let her.
Fuck... is it a big deal?
Maybe? I guess we'll find out.
Take her and Emiko up to my room. Let them lay there for a bit and see if she sobers up at all.
I'll go find the other girls and let them know where you are.
Sounds like a plan... thanks Zoe.
Don't mention it.
A few minutes later
Luckily they're both really light. But I guess that also helped them get wasted so quickly.
An hour or two in bed should be enough to sober Natalie a bit.
I'll need to tell Harp the truth anyways.
Kimmy? What are you doing in here still?
Why is she crying?
Where did you guys go??
Watch out. I have to lay Emiko down.
What happened to them?
They drank too much. What happened to you?
I came back here... but it was empty. I thought you guys ditched me.
No, we just went to what the girls called the 'party room'.
I thought they took everything out of it and locked the doors?
Hold on, let me put Natalie down.
Is everything okay Natalie?
Mmmmmmhmmmmmmmmmmmmm... per... perfect. Lay with meeee...
Hold on Natalie. Just lay there okay?
Do you know what time it is Kimmy?
No, Zoe keeps an alarm clock in her desk though. Try looking there.
Fuck, it's already midnight. Tonight flew by.
Why is there an alarm clock in the desk anyway?
So they have to get up to turn it off in the morning.
Oh, smart...
Fuck... That's another day gone already.
Kimmy...
How long have you been in here?
I don't know...
Why did you think we ditched you? Couldn't you have called one of the girls to see?
...
Sit down...
I thought they ditched me for you...
Why would they do that?
Ever since you came here... they all just want to talk about you.
I had my issues with you... I wasn't shy about them to you or anyone else. I figured they would be there for me.
Instead of trying to help me they all just tried to change my mind about you.
Kimmy, I'm sure they would have helped... Did you tell them what you told me?
Not all of it, I don't think they would've listened anyway.
I don't think that's true Kimmy. You have to remember this is a stressful time for all of them.
It's easy to look past someone else's problems especially if they aren't completely forthright about them.
I just wish you were open about it with me earlier. I have some solutions for your problems.
We really need to talk about them.
I'm sorry for being a bitch to you...
I understand why you were Kimmy. Do you want to go fix your makeup before we talk?
Yes please...
I'll be in here.
There's two empty houses Kimmy can stay in... So that's one problem fixed.
Damn, Emiko is out... At least she had a fun night.
[mcf]... Comeee...
Co.. come lay with meeee...
Okay, okay. I'm coming Natalie.
I'm... drunk.
I hadn't noticed. Your mom is going to be mad at me.
Nuhh uhh.
Did she tell you that you could drink?
Nuhh uhh.
That's what I thought.
Kiss meeee...
Not right now Nat. I will after you sober up okay?
Okayyy...
I'm sleepyyyy...
Do you want to rest for a moment? I need to take you home soon but a little rest can't hurt.
Mhmmmm... lay with meeee...
Uhh, sure.
You're cuteee...
Thank you, you are too.
Now go ahead and get some sleep. I'll be here.
[mcf].
How's everything?
Everything is handled. Harp is going to kill me but everything is okay.
That's good... the everything is okay part... not the killing.
Oh Zoe, you're sitting down.
Mhmmm, I'm still not comfortable but my legs don't go numb everytime I bend them now.
That's good. Hey...
What happened to that pen by the way?
What pen?
The one I put a certain somewhere... you fell and I never saw it again.
Oh my god I forgot about it!
I think it probably just flew across the room. You would know if it was still there.
I'll be back soon. I gotta check something.
Uhm, okay. I'll be here...
I just came to check on everyone. I'm still cleaning everything up.
Do you need any help?
No, no. Bailey and Penelope are already helping. They'll be over here soon.
I should head back to them.
Okay, I'll be here.
See you soon.
Zzzzzz
Oh damn, she's already out.
I hope it isn't weird but I want to lay down for a second myself.
I might as well make her comfy too.
There we go.
This is a pretty cute moment...
If you take away the part where I fucked up and didn't keep track of Nat so I could run around naked...
It's still peaceful...
*Loud snoring sounds* Hggghhhkkkk ahoo
Well... not as peaceful... but still cute.
This is a good time to check my phone. Nothing else to do.
Oh, I have a lot of messages...
There's one from Jasmine.
Hey [mcf]. I was just checking out your profile and it says you haven't logged in any in the past few days.
Did you ever check it out?
Do you want to check your social media? (Other game shoutouts)
I'm on it right now Jasmine... I totally didn't forget or anything...
Oh, cool. It's just some people showing their support.
Dev here... This is just me shouting out some fellow developers who were kind enough to make a selfie render for me.
Some of these are from months ago since that's when I asked for them... they were meant to be in Day 3. But I ended up losing data on release day and didn't have the time to re-add it.
So I would greatly appreciate you guys checking any of these games/devs out :)
This is Alison and Alice. Both are made by {a=https://www.patreon.com/onemanVN}OneManVN.{/a}
OMVN has given me advice when he really didn't have to. Advice I really needed at the time. He was also the first one to send me a selfie render.
His games are criminally underplayed. I urge you to check him and his games out. :) {a=https://www.patreon.com/onemanVN}OneManVN.{/a}
These two girls are from the game Fetish Locator made by {a=https://www.patreon.com/fetishlocator}ViNovella.{/a}
We use a lot of the same assets, so ViNovella clearly has some taste. ;p
And these two are from the game Healslut made by {a=https://www.patreon.com/dizzy}Davie Zwei.{/a}
Both him and ViNovella were also meant to be included in day 3. OMVN, Davie, and Vinovella never complained to me about the delay.
I owe them big time since I took time out of their development for this only for it to be delayed for months. That's on me.
So I highly urge you all to check them out.
Now finally we have...
These two girls who are from The Awakening and it's made by {a=https://www.patreon.com/SLim_Games}SLimGames.{/a}
He's recently declared me as his archenemy but his girls are hot so you should check his game out :D
Now back to WVM :)
Fuck, I haven't. I'll check it soon though.
Oh, I have a message from [g1].
Don't you miss this ass?
Shauna must've sent this from [g1]'s phone.
Hey Shauna... and damn right I do.
Hehe, how'd you know?
Check this other one out.
Her butt looks great even from the front.
Everything about her looks great. I miss you girls.
We miss you too.
That's only one of my girls' butts. I wouldn't mind seeing the other one...
Nope! Come home if you want to see it. You can even touch it if you want to.
Sounds like a plan then.
Here you go baby. She didn't notice me take it.
Haha, thank you babe.
And another one of me. We're thinking about you.
I hope you're having a good time but I also hope you're home soon.
You girls are both perfect. You're amazing and sexy as hell [g1].
And I'll be there soon. Get some rest though. I'll just snuggle up when I get there.
I might wake you up the same way you did me today.
I can't wait baby. xoxo <3
I fucking love those girls...
Oh shit, there's a message from Anna.
Hey [mcf]... I don't really take these kind of pictures but I was thinking about you.
I want to meet up again soon... if you don't mind.
I had a really good time last time.
It wasn't what I thought it would be. You were very kind and made me comfortable.
I would like to do it again... soon.
Like really soon...
I can't get you out of my head...
I want you [mcf].
I'd like to see you again Anna. Those were some great pictures.
You're so sexy. Just message me a time and day that's good for you.
It's late... doubt she'll reply until in the morning.
I have a lot on my plate right now Anna. We'll make sure you get your baby but it might take a few days until I'm free.
It's late... doubt she'll reply until in the morning... or at all.
I don't think I have to do these dates unless Rachael sets them up... I should clarify that with her.
Hmmm... there's a message from someone named Carly. I don't remember putting that contact into this phone.
Hey, just wanted to report in on the weight loss. Things are going great.
I'm hitting a wall and my number hasn't moved much but I'm working through it.
I'm finally fitting into some older clothes...
Oh my god! Wrong number! I'm sorry!
Huh, it's cool that she's losing weight. She looks good as is to me though.
But good for her. I wonder who she meant to send that to.
Oh shit, there's one last message... and it's from Alexis.
Hey [mcf]. How is WVM going?
Sorry for messaging you out of nowhere... I just saw something on the news about you and it made me think about things.
I never made the trip to my college. I'm still here at the diner...
Remember what we did in this bathroom stall? I've thought about it everyday.
You had me all like this... it was so great.
My face was stuck like that for like an hour.
Anyway... text me sometime.
Hey Alexis! What made you not go to college?
That's simple enough of a response... it's late though so I likely won't hear anything from her for a while.
Hmmm, I'm too busy with stuff here to keep talking to Alexis. For now anyway.
Zzzzzz....
Huh, I never really saw much of a resemblance in her and Harp... I can see it right now though.
I really need to get her home soon.
[mcf]?
Oh, Kimmy. Come here.
I'd come to you but I'm a little stuck...
Feeling any better?
Yeah, a little... I'm just really tired now.
I'll keep this short then.
Before anything... Can I count on you to be honest with me from here on out?
If something is bothering you then we can talk about it. No more crying in a room alone... just come find me or one of the girls.
I promise. I was a total bitch to you... I just could see my future slipping away from me.
I think this is more of a Charles issue than anything. He's tried to be my friend by gifting me things.
Yeah, I know what that's like... at least I used to. Enjoy it while you can.
I'm already trying to distance myself from him Kimmy. His 'friendship' will only last as long as I'm bringing him money and attention.
You said you were living in the green house? It was empty when I saw it... do you have the furniture?
No, I heard it was being moved to some storage building.
Well then there's another house and it's fully furnished. I'll take you there tomorrow and it will be completely yours.
[mcf]... that's too much... I don't want to uproot you from anywhere or anything...
I'm not living there Kimmy. I'm staying with someone else for right now and we're about to look for our own place. I'd be happy to give you the keys to that house.
That's... very kind of you... I don't know what to say.
You don't have to say anything. I just want you to be in a relatively safe place where you don't have to work multiple jobs just to get by.
Thank you... The other girls might've been right about you.
No problem Kimmy. I'll take you there tomorrow okay?
I look forward to it... you're helping me more than you'll ever know.
Woah! First you two were in my bed and now it's a threesome?
I'm going to head to bed [mcf]. I'll see you tomorrow... and thanks again.
Goodnight Kimmy, rest well.
I think she ignored me.
It's better than her storming off.
True.
So... did you find what you were looking for?
My search was unsuccessful. Which is a good thing.
Ha, well that's good. I'll refrain from using pens for now.
Hey [mcf]?
What's up?
Thanks for coming... it was nice having you around tonight.
I had a good time Zoe. I wouldn't mind doing this again soon.
Hey [mcf]?
What's up?
Thanks for coming... it was nice having you around tonight.
I had a good time Zoe. I wouldn't mind doing this again soon.
We'll be doing it again soon, don't worry.
What are the other girls doing by the way?
Rainn is asleep. Bailey and Penelope are just waiting around. Bailey is in the hall.
If you want to go talk to them, I can handle watching these two for a bit.
Are you sure?
Absolutely. I wouldn't mind laying down for a moment myself anyway.
Thanks Zoe. I'll be back soon to take Natalie home.
Mmmhhmmm.
Oh Nat, you're awake...
Nuh uhh... I'm asleep...
Oh... well I'll be back in just a moment. Just lay here and finish getting some rest okay?
Mhmmmm...
Mwah!
Oh, she just kissed me... A very inebriated kiss...
I'll be here... sleep...
Good girl, I'll be back in a bit.
That's cute... seeing Zoe checking on Emiko like that.
I get the feeling that she'd protect her through anything... total mama bear vibes.
Let me see what Penny and Bailey are up to.
Hey Bailey.
Hey [mcf]. How did flashing Lauren go?
All things considered I'd say it was a resounding success.
Oh yeah? Is that what you call it when you flash random women?
Isn't that how I got you?
You think you're funny huh?
I try my best.
Not to make it weird or anything... but have you told anyone besides Rainn about us?
Not directly... I don't want to make them jealous.
I assume they probably know though.
Oh, I was just wondering.
What makes you ask?
I don't know... just the lack of any mention of it I guess.
I didn't know if you'd be comfortable with it.
I wouldn't mind at all.
Well that's good to know.
Do you like my outfit?
It looks great on you. I like the shorts showing off your legs.
Is that all you like?
No, I like the way your nipples are poking through your shirt.
So you like the parts that show you what's underneath?
Pretty much, yeah.
I'm okay with that.
[g1] said she was okay with you coming over. As long as Shauna is cool with it too, then maybe I can see more tomorrow.
If you tell me to be there... I'll be there.
I'll let you know in class later.
I'm excited... there's a lot I want to do with you.
Now I'm excited too.
You should be. I won't be so shy this next time.
I'll hold you to that.
Mwah!
Oh shit, maybe she isn't joking about not being shy...
That's just a very short preview of what's to come.
Okay, now I'm really excited.
Uhhmm... [mcf]?
Ha, if that's what you want to call it.
Uhhm... [mcf]?
Oh, uh. Hey Penny.
I'm sorry you got caught... I should've went second.
Nah, I'm happy I'm the one that got caught. Lauren was very nice to me and I needed to talk to her.
So... I'm assuming you never did a lap?
I mean... no...
You owe us a lap then.
What?! You didn't finish your lap either!
I guess you both have to do a lap then.
I already did mine... so it's just you two.
I doubt we could get back into WVM.
We can do it here. Start on one side and run to the other.
Do we have to?
You've already seen eachother naked. What does it matter?
Everyone else is asleep. No one will see you.
I guess I'm down if you are [mcf].
I mean, got to live up to what we said we'd do earlier...
Ha, great. You two can start in the exercise room and run to the bathroom on the other end.
Doesn't sound too bad.
Just don't get caught this time.
Not planning on it.
Let's get this over with... again.
Ha, lead the way Penny.
There's worse things in life than running through a hall with a naked girl...
Especially when they have an ass like Penelope does.
Yep, I'm not mad that I get to look at that again.
[mcf]! Are you checking Penelope out?
Uhh...
Penny already told me I could look if I wanted to... that was earlier but I doubt she cares now.
Yes I was.
You were?
Like actually?
Yeah, I think you have a great butt Penny.
Thank you... you do too... I mean...
Thank you.
Is Bailey checking herself out?
She's got a smaller butt but it's still cute.
Oh! [mcf]!
I love your butt too Bailey.
You went from a peeper to a pervert!
Says the one dating a pervert.
But really, you have a great butt too Bailey.
Mwah!
Thank you. I want to see yours now.
So go get naked cowboy. Follow Penelope's butt.
You can look whenever... now follow me.
This is where we're starting?
Yep. Sure is.
As much as I wouldn't mind seeing you two undress. I'll go wait at the finish line.
You can stay if you want to. You've already seen us both already.
Yeah, but this is exciting for me.
Ha, fair enough.
Didn't think we'd be in this position again...
Still nervous?
Not as badly, no.
Let's do this then.
Penny's body language is more confident than before.
Oh shit, there's a mirror over there. She can see me checking her out.
Ehh, I got caught peeking at her ass already. Might as well get caught peeking at everything else.
[mcf]?
Mhmm?
I like it when you look at me like that...
I think you're beautiful Penny.
Is this how you make Shauna feel all the time?
I hope it is.
You can get a better look.
I wish they were bigger...
I don't.
Small can be sexy... and you're definitely sexy.
You can touch them...
Mmmm...
Very different than grabbing [g1]'s or Shauna's... but still nice.
A small handful with a firm bud poking your palm in the middle.
Do you like them?
I love them Penny.
I wouldn't mind... if we did this again...
I wouldn't either... but Bailey is waiting on us right now.
True. Let's finish getting undressed.
There's that ass... out of clothes. Wouldn't mind a better view of it either.
Don't want to give off the wrong impression to her.
Now to just finish getting undressed... looking this way.
Ready to run down this hallway?
Ready as ever.
Let's do this.
I went first last time. You go ahead.
Let's go at the same time [mcf]. I'll lead the way though.
Deal. I'm right behind you.
Damn, she's running for it. Probably more embarrassed than she's letting on.
Fuck, she's pretty fast actually.
Wait... did that door just open?
AHHH!!
Oh fuck!
AHH!!
Oh my god, I landed where I'm basically thrusting into her... shit.
I'm so sorry Ruby... 
Let me help you up...
...
Are you okay?
You scared me.
Oh thank god she isn't mad.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
Why are you naked?
Lost a bet essentially.
Damn, Penny is already gone. She was probably just focused on finishing.
Do you need some clothes? I have an extra pair of shorts you can wear to get back.
If you don't mind then sure...
That would help me out a ton.
I don't mind at all. Just step into my room for a second. But be quiet... my sister is sleeping.
Okay, I'll be quiet.
My bed is the one on the end. Just don't be loud... she might freak out if she saw you.
That must be her sister.
She seems somewhat familiar.
Do you think those will fit?
Only one way to find out.
They definitely don't do me any favors but they'll work. Thank you Ruby.
Good... you can sit for a moment...
I didn't expect to run into you tonight.
Technically I ran into you.
Hehe, true. So how did you like that gazebo I recommended?
It was perfect. Thanks for that again Ruby.
Anytime... and now that you're somewhat clothed I can give you a hug.
Huh, it's been a minute since I've had a proper hug. I guess that's just because I'm not around [g1] or Shauna. I miss all my hugs.
I want to talk to you some more. But you should go get all your clothes on first.
Carly could come home any minute and I don't want to explain why you're half naked in my bed.
All right, I'll be back in a minute.
I'll walk you out. Let me go first.
Those are the same shorts she handed me... I think Liz was wearing them too. I guess WVM gives them out.
Damn, her sister is barely still on her bed.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she tends to sleep half off the bed.
If you say so... it's a bit stressful though.
Oh shit!
Damn, that timing.
AHHH!!
