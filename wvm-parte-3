It's okay, I got you. You just fell off your bed.
Oh wow! Nice catch [mcf]!
Oh my god! You're [mcf]!
That's me.
Damn, that mood switch.
I've talked about you so much that I started to feel like you weren't even real.
Oh! You're the girl I saw on the news earlier.
That's me, Moon.
I think you can sit her down now [mcf].
Oh, right.
Thank you for saving me. It isn't the first time I've fallen out of bed.
Oh... uhh... Why are you in my sister's shorts?
I lost a bet and had to streak down the hallway. I accidentally ran into Ruby. She helped me out with the shorts.
She's been looking for quite a long time.
That was nice of her.
Yep, she's great.
Thank you.
If she's looking then I might as well take a look at her myself.
Wow, she's a little bigger but she still has a nice body...
Ahem... [mcf].
We should be heading out. Don't you think?
Uhh, yeah. Sure.
Damn, Ruby wasn't a fan of that.
Wait, wait.
I'm sorry for asking but is there any chance you'd be willing to do an interview sometime?
It would be for the WVM news. You'd be helping me out a ton.
Sure, I'm down to do that.
Oh wow! Thank you! I'll get in touch with you soon okay?
Sounds perfect. Goodnight Moon. Be careful.
I will, goodnight [mcf].
I'm sorry Moon, I don't want that much of my personal life out there.
Oh... I understand. If you change your mind let me know...
I will. Goodnight Moon and be careful.
Mhmmm... goodnight.
Time to go get my clothes... I wonder what Bailey and Penelope think happened to me.
Ruby is walking ahead pretty quickly... like she's avoiding anymore conversation.
Although it's likely she's just uncomfortable since I did just run into her while I was completely nude.
I should make sure she isn't upset about me looking at Moon.
Ruby.
Is everything okay?
No... I was helping you out so no one would ogle at you.
Then she goes ahead and does it anyway... I'm sorry.
Oh no, it's fine Ruby. I knew the risks when I ran through here in my birthday suit.
She was also probably pretty shocked to be woken up like that with me holding her. So everything is fine.
And thank you again for helping me, I'm sorry for putting you through this.
I'm happy to help. I think you'd do the same for me.
I would, I don't think you're the type to run around without clothes though.
I didn't think you were either.
Heh, fair point.
Now let's get you into some clothes that fit.
For a guy dumb enough to get caught streaking twice in the same night, things couldn't have gone much better for me.
Ruby is cool, I don't think she's even peeked below my shoulders. Lauren definitely wasn't as courteous but that isn't a big deal to me.
I am the one that flashed them after all.
There he is!
Seems like someone can't help but get caught...
Oh my god... those look really cute on you [mcf].
Yeah, yeah... I got caught again.
I can't say I'm surprised.
Is everything okay Penny?
I can't find my sweater...
What happened to it?
It's just missing...
Just use my shirt. I don't mind.
So what happened? Penny said she didn't see you get caught.
That's because of how quickly she was booking it through the hallway. I ran into Ruby as she was leaving her room.
Holy shit!
He got me pretty good. But it's not a big deal.
She helped me out with these shorts.
They look great on you.
Are you sure about your shirt?
Go for it. I've only had four people see me nude. A few more seeing me shirtless won't kill me.
A few moments later
Thank you [mcf]. You're a life saver.
Don't mention it Penny. I'm just curious where your sweater could've went.
Yeah, me too.
Hey [mcf]. I think I'm going to head home.
Yeah, I'm about to do the same. Where's Rainn?
She's already in the car. She needed to lie down.
So yeah... I'll see you in a few hours at practice.
Goodnight Bailey.
Goodnight [mcf].
I think it's time for our first kiss in front of others...
Mwah!
[mcf]...
I'll see you in a bit Bailey.
Mhmmm... you sure will. Goodnight.
Goodnight Bailey.
Seeing her face light up like that is always insanely cute.
I'll mess with her some at practice tomorrow if I can.
You two are a thing?
Oh, uhh. Yeah, only for like a day and a half now though.
I can't say I expected that.
Is that a bad thing?
No, not at all. It's your life. Why should I have a say in it?
But...
[mcf].
I think I'm going to head back as well.
Okay Ruby, thanks again for helping me. I owe you.
You don't owe me anything.
Goodnight [mcf].
Goodnight Ruby, I'll see you in class tomorrow.
Are you leaving now too?
Uhh, I'm not in a huge hurry. I'd like Natalie to be as sobered up as possible before I take her home.
So if you'd like we could chat for a minute.
Of course, I'd love to.
Let's sit for a moment then.
So what would you like to talk about?
Uhh, tonight's been a little crazy. I didn't anticipate streaking twice.
You weren't weirded out by any of it were you?
No, it's been a good experience. I was incredibly nervous but I think it's a good thing for me to break out of my shell some.
Good, I'm glad to hear it.
It's all pretty surreal...
I went from reading articles about you to running naked with you...
If I went back in time and told that girl reading those articles that tonight would go the way it did, she would never believe me.
There's a lot I want to say to you...
About how you've changed my life without even being a part of it.
I just don't know how to form the sentences to not make me sound crazed.
Don't worry about that. You don't have to tell me anything you're not comfortable talking about.
I'm happy I've had an effect on your life already, I hope to have a bigger effect on it this year.
Look at me Penny.
It's going to be a good year. We're going to get you out of that shell some more.
I'd like that...
We should set up some time to-
Mwah!
Oh... oh my god I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that [mcf].
It's fine Penny.
Goodnight.
Penny?
Wow, she's sprinting out of here. That must've really embarrassed her for some reason.
Fuck, I really wanted to ask her more about those articles she keeps talking about.
Some other time, then.
Guess it's time to take Nat home...
Yeah, I should really be getting Natalie home now.
Oh... okay. I'll see you tomorrow then [mcf].
Goodnight Penny.
Goodnight.
I wonder what I've missed over here.
I better be quiet as I go inside.
Hey there... I've stolen your role of bed cuddler.
Yeah, I see that.
It's pretty damn comfy.
Ha, well I'm going to have to ruin it. I'm going to take Natalie home now.
I gave her some water, hopefully it helped.
You're taking me home? Why are you shirtless?
Oh good you're already awake.. and it's a long story.
And she sounds way less drunk.
Yeah, it's really late. Harper is probably worried about you. You ready to go?
Mhmm...
Goodnight Zoe. Thank you for inviting me.
Woah... you can stick a pen in me but can't even give me a goodbye kiss?
Very classy.
Mwah!
Thank you.
I thought you said you didn't want to be treated like a girlfriend?
That's not what I said, you can treat me like one as much as you'd like.
You're going to cheer for me even harder than you would before, right?
I might, might not.
I expected no other answer.
Goodnight pen boy.
Goodnight pen girl.
Thank you for coming. Would've sucked without you.
I'll see you at practice?
You can count on it. Goodnight [mcf].
Goodnight Zoe.
You have everything you need?
My jacket is still downstairs but I can get it tomorrow.
Are you sure?
Yeah, it isn't very cold tonight, which is a good thing for you.
Can you walk to my car or do you need me to carry you?
I could probably walk but I won't say no to a piggy back ride.
Ha, let's get going then. The sooner I have you home the better.
About 20 minutes later.
Is she asleep?
Yeah, she must've fallen asleep waiting on me to come home.
Should we wake her?
She doesn't like to be woken up.
I should really tell her about how tonight went.
What? That I drank a few beers?
I know you promised her that you'd watch over me, but I'm not some little child.
I'm home, I'm safe. We don't need to wake her.
Yeah... okay. I'll just head home then.
You don't have to do that...
At least not right away... it's hard for me to sleep alone.
Nothing funny, just can you lay down with me until I fall asleep?
Natalie, what would Harper think if she saw me shirtless in bed with you?
She's a very heavy sleeper. Come on, I'm really sleepy. It won't take long.
Okay, okay. Two rules. I stay above the cover and no touching. I don't want to get murdered tonight.
Deal. Thank you.
Which side do you usually sleep on?
The one with the wall. Mom likes to be on the outside just so she could defend me if something happened or whatever.
Oh... makes sense.
So... did you have fun tonight?
Yeah, nothing went how I expected it to. Although that's a good thing. I just wish I would've kept a closer eye on you.
I'm totally fine [mcf]. I had two drinks while I was with friends.
I know that, but I promised your mom I would watch after you. It doesn't feel good to break that.
You did. You got me home safely, you were even nice enough to stick around and help me go to sleep.
Mom can be over protective...
Yeah... I'm just afraid of how she'll react. I want to maintain a good relationship with her.
AHHHHHHHH!!!
Was that Harper?
Yeah, yeah. It's okay [mcf].
She has nightmares, and sometimes she screams in them. They're worse this time of year... She hasn't had one recently though.
Should we do something?
No, they don't last very long usually.
Me being out for the night probably just has her nerves in a bunch. Everything is okay.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
AHHHH!!! HELP!!
GIVE HER!!!
Oh wow, she hasn't been this loud in a long time...
I can't listen to this Natalie. I have to wake her.
[mcf]...
Harper...
AHHhhhh!
GIVE HER BACK!!!
Fuck, I don't want to have to scream over her to wake her up.
I wish she wasn't in her underwear, I wouldn't feel weird about shaking her then.
AHHHHHH!!!
Harper! Wake up!
AHHhhh!
Oh fuck.
[mcf]!
Fuck, she got my nose. She pulled her punch back a bit before she connected though.
Oh my god! [mcf]? Are you okay?
[mcf], I'm so sorry!
What happened? Are you okay?
I'm fine Harp, you just made my eyes a little watery.
I didn't mean to, I'm so sorry!
It's fine, I was just trying to wake you up from your nightmare. I should've been ready for that.
Are you okay?
Where is Natalie?
I'm right here mom.
I'm okay, [mcf] got me home completely safe and sound.
Oh honey...
It's okay mom, everything is okay.
I'm safe. I promise. No need to worry.
I'm sorry honey, I didn't mean to ruin your night.
You're not. I had a great time.
Good... just next time don't stay out so late. You had me worried...
I'm sorry mom, we lost track of time.
I wonder if Harp can smell alcohol on Nat's breath...
Are you ready for bed honey?
Yeah, we can head to bed.
That my cue to leave?
Why are you shirtless?
Uhh...
He let me wear his shirt since I was chilly... I accidentally left my jacket.
He was just walking me inside so I left it in his car.
Oh, that was very sweet of you [mcf].
I don't like lying to her... but it's the best way to handle it right now.
I'll walk you out [mcf].
Wait... let me say something to him first.
I'll be by the door.
Thank you for keeping an eye on her... I hope it didn't ruin your party at all.
No, we both had a great time. I'm sorry I got her home so late.
Don't worry about that right now... I might punish you with some laps later but nothing tonight.
I'll take that.
I'm sorry you saw me like this too... not my most flattering of moments.
I've had some weird dreams here lately too Harp. I understand. No need to feel embarrassed.
Trust me, don't worry about this at all. We don't have to ever talk about this again.
There's some things I do want to talk about. Just not tonight. We should all be in bed.
You're right.
I'll see you at practice Harp.
We're going to start out in the actual gym tomorrow. Get all of you guys on some weights.
Good, it's been a minute since I've truly exercised. Goodnight Harper.
Goodnight [mcf].
Your interesting night continues.
That it does, should be ending very soon though.
I'm sorry you had to go through this. I didn't know that would happen.
It's okay, I don't want to be nosy but are the nightmares always that extreme?
It depends... they can be.
How long have they been a thing?
Since I was a kid.
I guess I can tell you why... Promise not to tell anyone else?
I promise.
When I was a little girl it was just me and my mom... we were in the store one day and I wandered off to look at the cereal.
A guy ended up grabbing me and tried to run off with me. I screamed and my mom came running.
The guy ran out of the store and threw me into the passenger seat from the driver's side. The car was already running and he slammed on the gas.
I remember looking back and seeing mom running as fast as she could at the car. The look of dread on her face...
There was an immediate police chase. The guy never broke the speed limit, never talked to me, anything.
We went until he ran out of gas. Which was a few hours. I'm confused about it to this day and I know how awful she must've felt.
And I understand why she's protective. But I still have to live my life.
I'm sorry you went through that Natalie. That's awful.
Looking back on it, yeah. As a kid I never understood what happened.
I'm just happy everything turned out okay and that you're here now.
Yeah, me too.
Mwah!
Hehe, so yeah. That's a story I haven't told anyone in a long time.
Thank you for telling me.
Like I've said before. I think you're going to be a big part of our lives. So might as well be open about things.
I appreciate it Nat, I really do.
Now you should be headed home. I'll see you at practice.
You're going to be there?
Yep. You'll see.
I'll be sure to wear a cup then.
Very funny.
Haha, goodnight Nat.
Goodnight [mcf].
Time to head home...
A few minutes later
You're still awake mom?
There you are!
Did you stay up for me?
Maybe... we did sleep for a few hours in the middle of the day. Sit down.
How was the party?
It was fun. How was chilling here?
It's fun too...
But?
I miss working. I've never been one to just sit around all day.
Speaking of, I need to stretch.
Ohhmmmnnnn... that feels good.
Good stretch?
Mhmmmm...aaahhh
I'm getting old.
Oh, woah.
What is it?
Nothing... it's just your hair.
What about it?
The entire time you've been my mom I've never seen it change.
You're being silly.
I'm being serious.
Well? How does it look?
I like it. I'm not saying you need to change anything. I just didn't realize that you've always rocked the same style.
You know I don't care that much about my looks...
Although I've been noticing some small things recently. I think it's just my mind having more time to think about the little things.
I have an idea.
What is it?
It's to solve that issue and your cabin fever.
Me and you, spa day and dinner one night soon, just the two of us.
Honey, I'd love to but you have two girls to take care of. You don't need to worry about me too.
Nonsense. Come on mom. I insist.
I'll never say no to that honey.
Great! Tomorrow night sound good with you?
Anytime you want to go honey. Whenever is good for you.
I'll let you know for sure sometime soon.
Mwah!
Once again, these kisses continue to linger.
I couldn't ask for a better son.
And I couldn't ask for a better mom. You must be exhausted waiting this late for me.
Yeah... a little.
I just wanted to see you again before I slept. With you going to school I wouldn't see you for a long time.
When you have a son like I do, you want to see him as much as you can.
Mom... what if you had another son?
What do you mean?
Like what if you just had a dream one night that you had another son? And then things start playing out that proves it's true?
I think we both need to go to bed.
I'm being serious mom.
That's hard to answer. I don't want any other son. You're all I need.
Plus, we don't have to worry about anything like that.
Though, if it does turn out that you have a sister and she wants to be in our lives, then I'll treat her like a daughter.
Well I feel the same way mom, all of a sudden there's another mom in my life. But you're all I need.
But I still feel like I have to meet her.
I'd imagine I'd feel the same way. It's okay honey.
We'll get through all of this together. I'll always be your mom.
Damn right.
Language.
Ha, sorry.
I'm sleepy...
Close your eyes, get some rest.
Goodnight honey.
Goodnight mom.
I'm pretty tired myself... I don't even know what time it is.
I should stay awake...
But sleep sounds very nice.
...
...
An hour later
Pssst, get up.
Hmmm?
Rachael?
You two should cuddle more often, it's cute.
Thanks? Why did you wake me up?
Get up.
Okay?
I have to be on a flight soon. I'll be back tonight. I just need to talk to you about a few things first.
Oh, okay.
Come to my room.
Sure.
Fuck... I feel groggy.
[mcf]!
What are you doing up Stacy?
Talking to my mom. She works nights so I'm keeping her company.
Come say hi to her!
One second Stacy. Rachael needs to talk to me.
Okay, we'll be here.
So first off, good morning.
Good morning.
Take a seat.
Okay... so all woken up? Ready to talk?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Okay, this has to be quick. So we're going to do this rapid fire like.
Let's do it.
So a few things. First the housing arrangement... I have an idea that would make it easier on everyone.
I stayed up pretty late considering it.
What is it?
Well... what if we all moved in together?
Here?
No, as much as I'd love for you all to stay here... I need my office space.
I also don't really want to live here.
If the girls are cool with it then I am Rachael.
Perfect. I didn't want all of you to leave me.
Do you have any places picked out?
There's one. We'll go look at it tomorrow.
Sounds good with me.
Oh also, about your mom. Your biological mom.
She did purchase a plane ticket to here two nights ago. So that was almost definitely her you ran into.
Wow... okay.
Any other news on her?
My guy hasn't talked to me today yet... so nothing as of right now.
Dev here. Sorry for the interruption but due to a little accident where I put one too many '=''s to save the variable. I need to ask again.
Did you accept Rachael's offer to work for her to impregnate clients? (This will only be here for day 6)
And finally... time for a client.
Now I can't tell you her name yet. And I can't tell you why... and I need you to sign a contract before you leave.
Okay... that's a lot of things.
All you have to do is tell me if you're interested.
Here look.
She's very beautiful.
Yeah, she is. Are there more photos?
Three more.
She has a nice butt.
Watch your tongue.
Oh... sorry.
Didn't think that was that crude of a comment... considering she's showing me images of a client.
She has a very soft vibe.
Yeah, you don't even know.
I can't look at this last one.
Oh wow...
Shush, I don't want to hear it.
So what do you say? Are you interested in her?
Yeah, absolutely. Set it up.
Perfect! I'll text you more details later today.
Sounds good Rachael. Thank you.
No, thank you.
Uhh... I don't know Rachael. I'm not feeling it.
Hmm... okay.
Sorry Rachael.
It is what it is... you're good. Not going to force you into anything.
And finally... time for your first client.
Now I can't tell you her name yet. And I can't tell you why... and I need you to sign a contract before you leave.
Okay... that's a lot of things.
All you have to do is tell me if you're interested.
Here look.
She's very beautiful.
Yeah, she is. Are there more photos?
Three more.
She has a nice butt.
Watch your tongue.
Oh... sorry.
Didn't think that was that crude of a comment... considering she's showing me images of a client.
She has a very soft vibe.
Yeah, you don't even know.
I can't look at this last one.
Oh wow...
Shush, I don't want to hear it.
So what do you say? Are you interested in her?
Yeah, absolutely. Set it up.
Perfect! I'll text you more details later today.
Sounds good Rachael. Thank you.
No, thank you.
Uhh... I don't know Rachael. I'm not feeling it.
Hmm... okay.
Sorry Rachael.
It is what it is... you're good. Not going to force you into anything.
Where are you going Rachael?
That's all I had to talk about. Going to go take my shower now.
Uhh... Rachael.
What is it?
Oh, haha. They have a mind of their own sometimes.
I don't mind.
Well I'm sure you don't.
You know... with us living together, we could have a lot of fun.
Why do you think I said yes?
My charming personality and big green eyes?
Yep, absolutely those things. Nothing else.
Oh, she's sucking on my neck.
That feels fucking good too.
Think about that today... While you're in class even. Think about how it would feel other places.
I didn't take you for the tease type Rachael.
I can be a bit of everything.
I'll see you tonight.
Sorry about that. You might should get used to them if we're going to live together though.
Boobs are boobs Rachael. You're not offending me.
Good. Now time for my shower.
Rachael sure is always entertaining to say the least... 
Guess it's time to go meet Stacy's mom... and hopefully it isn't how I meet my own mom either...
I wonder how Stacy would react.
Hey Stacy, you still talking to your mom?
Hey, yep. Sure am...
She's excited to meet you.
Hey mom! He's back.
Say hey to her [mcf]. Her name is Margaret
Not even close... Thank god.
Hey Margaret. It's nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you too young man. Are you taking care of Stacy?
Yes ma'am. She's in safe hands.
That's great to hear. She seems happy.
I hope she is. How is your night going?
Boring, but thank you for asking. I'm about to have to focus on work.
I hope you get through it quickly.
You're a very polite young man.
Get closer to the screen. You have the most amazing eyes.
Momma stop.
Sorry honey. It was very nice to meet you [mcf].
Pleasure is all mine Margaret.
I'll be visiting soon. You two have a good night now.
You're leaving mom?
I have to focus on work. I'll call you in the morning.
Goodnight momma.
I think you made her shy. She didn't have to leave just yet.
Maybe she didn't like me?
No, no. She likes you.
Any questions?
What do you mean?
About her age...
I mean, she was older than I imagined.
She's actually my grandma. But she raised me.
Oh, why didn't you tell me that?
I don't know...
Don't you think I'd understand? Considering my whole mom situation.
I know, I should've told you sooner. It's silly.
Thank you for talking to her.
I didn't mind at all Stacy. She seems like a lovely lady.
She is.
Are you heading to bed?
Yeah, gonna try to sleep until I have to get up for practice.
I suppose I'll see you in class then.
Yes you will. Goodnight Stacy.
Goodnight [mcf].
Time to find my girls.
There they are. Damn, they look comfy.
I wouldn't mind just laying down in between them.
I did tell [g1] that I'd return the favor when I got home...
But it's really late...
Wearing the black and yellow to sleep even... The yellow has to go.
She's absolutely perfect... I'm lucky that she's mine.
She barely even moved when I took her shorts off.
Fuck... she's out cold. I did keep them up really late and made them sleep in due to me passing out...
I shouldn't wake her up... no matter how badly I want to.
I'll just cuddle up with them and call it a night. I'll leave her shorts down just to make her think I did something.
That'll be funny.
This is fucking cozy... I wish I could turn the lights out... not really sure how to do that in this place.
Oh well. I'll be fine.
Oh, [g1] just cuddled up to me in her sleep.
I fucking love this girl. She's everything I could ever ask for.
Shauna is too... I'm going to give them both a kiss on the head goodnight.
Mwah.
Mwah.
Now, it's time to sleep... again.
Zzz...
Zzz......
Hmmm? That feeling... again?
Wake up baby.
Goodmorning.
Goodmorning babe.
It was a nice surprise waking up next to you. I thought you might wake me up...
I was going to, then felt guilty since I've made your sleep pretty sporadic these last few days.
Is that why my shorts were down?
Ha, yeah... it took a lot to stop myself.
Where's Shauna?
She's probably catching her breath. We've been trying to wake you up for a bit.
So she's under the- Ohhhhh....
Is she back at it?
Mhmmm... she's doing a great job too.
She's getting you ready for me.
I woke up hard as diamonds... I'd say I've been ready.
She's definitely getting the job done.
I had more dreams about us. Some of them went a little like this. So I'm very ready myself.
I am too baby.
It's hot under here.
We don't need the blanket anymore.
What do you think Shauna? Is he ready?
Mmmm... just a second.
I think she's just having fun at this point.
Sorry [g1]. It's easy to get lost in doing that. I could bob my head up and down on it for hours without even thinking about it.
I want to bob my entire body on it...
He's ready.
I love you [mcf].
I love you too [g1].
I'll help you two out.
Ahhhhmmmmnnnn.....
Oh wow, your cock is throbbing [mcf].
Tell me about it.
Aaahhhh... this hasn't gotten any easier yet [mcf].
It will. It's gotten somewhat easier though right?
Mhmm. It has. I just have to relax and let it slide in me...
Hmmmm....
Ahhhmmmm... it's harder when you're not in control.
We can change positions [g1].
Nuh uh, I want to do this.
Oh my god... it feels like it's going to go on forever.
You're almost there, you got this... just relax.
Shauna is rubbing my balls as [g1] tries to slide her way down to them...
These are the kind of memories I want to have.
Was this worth being woken up for?
Absolutely. I'll return the favor one night.
Hehe... there's something missing though.
What is it?
Boobies!
Oh! Shauna!
Was I right?
You definitely weren't wrong. The more times I get to see [g1]'s breasts, the better.
Thank you baby.
Now that you two are appropriate, get on down [g1].
OHHHMMM....
Moan it out... He's going to end up stretching us both out.
Mmmmmmmmmm... I don't think I can move any...
My legs are too shaky.
Just rock back and forth babe... trust me. It'll feel great.
Okay...
Ohhhh baby... That feels fucking good.
You're so tight [g1].
These subtle movements are crazy... they're making me want to flip her over and just fuck her...
It's good though... just not what I'm used to.
Fuck baby... You're so big.., Mmmmmm...
It feels so fucking.... Mmmmm.... so fucking good...
She's right... it feels fucking great. I don't think I could cum from this but it's still good.
Oh [g1]... your face is getting all red.
Are you about to?
OHHHMMMAaaaa!!
Fuck baby...
Damn [mcf]. That was fast...
I'm not done... I can go more.
Oh fuck baby!
Damn [g1]! Ride him!
Fuck [g1]! Keep going!
AHHHNNNNNGG!!
AHHHHNNNGGGGGGG!!!!!
Damn [g1]!
Oh my god!!!!
Just a few more thrusts! I'm...
AAAHHMMM!
Oh wow! [mcf]!
Holy shit...
Holy shit is right... that was amazing.
You came inside me again... really deep.
Sorry, I couldn't control myself [g1]. You just felt so fucking great.
No, no. I wanted you to.
Should we start buying condoms?
No, we don't need them.
Oh...
How was I?
You were great, did you like being on top?
I liked seeing you react and it felt just as great as everything else...
But I like it more when you're in control.
You sure you're done [mcf]? You're still hard.
Huh, I am... I feel finished...
Could you go again?
Fuck it, we can try.
I want to suck on it some more.
Go for it Shauna.
Oh fuck...
That's great Shauna, I'm absolutely still able to go.
Let me help...
Oh, [g1]...
These girls are too much, doing whatever they can to please me...
I'm grateful for them but I can't help but feel guilty having them focus this much on me.
I like that babe.
There she goes with her serious face again.
It seems to be everytime she uses her mouth in a sexual way, it's really cute.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm just admiring you is all, thinking about how much I love the two of you.
We love you too baby.
But uhh... don't you think something is missing with Shauna?
Boobies?
And butt. I'll get the shirt, you get the shorts.
Shauna didn't even react to us taking her clothes off, she's just going at it.
And fuck, she's getting even better at it. Just long and slow strokes followed by her going all out for a few seconds.
She keeps mixing it up.
I wouldn't mind playing with her a bit as she continues.
Just going to pull her on top of me.
There... and again she doesn't react.
Is she really that into sucking me off?
She's better than me when it comes to blowjobs.
Babe, you're great too.
It's okay. It's good that she is. We can offer you different things.
Were you about to do something to her?
Well, uhhh. Yeah.
Give me your hand.
Woah... either she wanted to show off her sucking skills too or she just really likes my finger.
Or she's just lubing my finger up for Shauna...
Go for it baby...
Don't mind if I do.
Oh, that went in easier than I expected...
Ohhhh!
Well that got a reaction out of her.
What are you doing [mcf]?!
Having a little fun of my own back here.
I was having fun [mcf]...
Oh, I didn't mean to ruin your fun. You were doing a fucking fantastic job.
Why did it ruin it though? I was just trying to pleasure you some too.
You didn't ruin it... I was just really into what I was doing.
I was into it too. I didn't mean to take you out of it.
Why is it so bad that I did?
[mcf]... it's embarrassing.
I can step out for a second... I have to use the ladies room.
[g1]...
What? We're all still new to this. We're not going to all be perfectly comfortable right away.
There's still things I don't want to say in front of Shauna yet.
We'll get there, but it's okay not to be there right now. In fact there's some things I'd like to talk to you about...
You can talk to me whenever you want to [g1]. But thank you.
Her level of maturity about all of this is crazy.
I'll be back in a few minutes... just let me know if I need to leave when I come back.
I will, thank you again [g1].
No problem baby.
She really is perfect huh?
She's definitely as close as anyone could get.
So tell me Shauna. It's important to be open and honest about what you are and aren't comfortable with.
[mcf]... it's not like that.
You couldn't make me uncomfortable. I'm willing to do anything with you...
It's just a little personal thing.
It might make me sound crazy... but I really like doing what I was just doing...
For more reasons than just making you feel good... it makes me feel good.
You helped me throughout my entire life.
You never expected anything from me but you'd do anything for me.
And I always wanted to be your girl...
We've been through a lot... and through all of those things I've grown to love you... immensely.
And through that love came other feelings... I used to dream about pleasing you... about how it would be.
How my lips would move on you... the sounds you would make.
Now the crazy part... when I'm going down on you I forget about it all. All of the shit we've gone through.
All of the people you've had to protect me from. All of the negatives... just gone.
I'm just your girl, fixated on pleasing you. Doing what a good girl would do.
You are my good girl...
You'll always be my good girl Shauna.
Do you not feel that way when we have sex though?
Of course I do... there's different elements to that though.
I like it when it's just my mouth and your penis... it's simple, I love feeling it slide on my tongue. The heat of it...
Sex is amazing... it's equal to me blowing you. But I do really like losing myself in it...
I think that's a good problem to have... I like sex though because we're both getting pleasure.
True... I like it too.
Do you want to?
Of course I do. Lay down.
You have such a nice pussy Shauna.
Thank you...
I'm ready...
Your cock is so big [mcf]... especially next to me...
Oh! Looks like I missed a lot.
Is it okay for me to be back?
Mhmmm... it is. Thank you [g1].
I assume everything is okay?
Everything is perfect.
Well then don't let me interrupt. Go ahead and let her have it.
Please baby?
Where did that please come from?... I liked it though.
Ohhhhmmm! Fuck!
Ohhh, thank you baby.
Fuck, fuck... mmmmmm...
Are you okay Shauna?
Mhmmm... just give me a little more warning next time.
Wow... give me a second to relax and then you can start... you're so fucking big.
Come on Shauna, be his good girl.
Mhmmm... I'm ready [mcf].
That was a little too quick... I'm going to start out real slow.
Oh fuck [mcf]... MMmmmm...
How does she feel [mcf]?
Tight... very tight. In a very good way.
And he's big... very big.
Fuck [mcf]... Mmmmmm... Keep going...
Fuck me harder [mcf]. You don't have to go easy.
Are you sure Shauna?
Fuck me hard [mcf].
I'll fuck her... but not as hard as I can. Not yet anyway.
OHHH!! Fuck!!
Fuck her baby... cum deep inside of her just like you did me.
FUCK! That's so fucking good!
[mcf]... I can't! You're gonna...
OOHHHHHMMMM FUCK! I'm gonna cum!
Cum with me Shauna!
AHHOOOOHHHMMMMM!!! Fuck...
OHNNN...
Did you give Shauna a lot too?
It feels like it.
I'm not sure how much I had left in me after you, but she got all I had.
Which might not have been a lot...
That was fucking great [mcf]!
Fuck yeah it was... how's your legs?
Not as shaky as last time...
Let me try to sit up...
Oh yeah, they're still shaky...
Take it easy Shauna, we'll get better at it.
There... and again she doesn't react.
Is she really that into sucking me off?
She's better at that than me.
Babe, you're great too.
It's okay. It's good that she is. We can offer you different things.
Were you about to do something to her?
Well, uhhh. Yeah.
Give me your hand.
Woah... either she wanted to show off her sucking skills too or she just really likes my finger.
Or she's just lubing my finger up for Shauna...
Go for it baby...
Don't mind if I do.
Oh, that went in easier than I expected...
Ohhhh!
Well that got a reaction out of her.
What are you doing [mcf]?!
Having a little fun of my own back here.
I was having fun [mcf]...
Oh, I didn't mean to ruin your fun. You were doing a fucking fantastic job.
Why did it ruin it though? Nothing changed.
Yes it did...
Let me sit up.
Sorry Shauna, you didn't react to me pulling you on top of me, I thought you knew where I was going.
I was busy...
Why is it a big deal though? It's not our first time doing something together now.
[mcf]... it's embarrassing.
I can step out for a second... I have to use the ladies room.
[g1]...
What? We're all still new to this. We're not going to all be perfectly comfortable right away.
There's still things I don't want to say in front of Shauna yet.
We'll get there, but it's okay not to be there right now. In fact there's some things I'd like to talk to you about...
You can talk to me whenever you want to [g1]. But thank you.
Her level of maturity about all of this is crazy.
I'll be back in a few minutes... just let me know if I need to leave when I come back.
I will, thank you again [g1].
No problem baby.
She really is perfect huh?
She's definitely as close as anyone could get.
So tell me Shauna. It's important to be open and honest about what you are and aren't comfortable with.
[mcf]... it's not like that.
You couldn't make me uncomfortable. I'm willing to do anything with you...
It's just a little personal battle.
It might make me sound crazy... but I really like doing what I was just doing...
For more reasons than just making you feel good... it makes me feel good.
You helped me realize who I really am. I'm a girl.
But it's more than that. I'm your girl... I've always wanted to be.
I don't always feel like one though...
I don't like my lower half... I don't think I ever will... I'd like to forget it was there.
Now the crazy part... when I'm going down on you I forget about it all. All of the shit we've gone through.
All of the people you've had to protect me from. All of the negatives... just gone.
I'm just your girl, fixated on pleasing you. Doing what a good girl would do.
You are my good girl...
I've told you before that your lower half doesn't make you any less of a girl to me.
It doesn't make me think differently of you in any way. I wouldn't change a thing about you Shauna.
I think you would be happier if I had a vagina...
Shauna...
I can't give you kids like [g1] can.
I'm happy with exactly how you are... if you weren't who you were then we may have never met.
Maybe I wouldn't have noticed you on that day, there may be a reality out there where we don't know each other.
Fuck that reality. I only care about you Shauna, not about what sexual organs you have. I love you for you.
I love you too [mcf]... I always have. It's just a struggle I have...
You'll never be comfortable with me in a sexual way until you're comfortable with yourself.
If you want to make changes then that's up to you. It's your body...
But I want you to know that I'll love you the exact same no matter what. It doesn't mean anything to me Shauna.
Let me see.
[mcf]...
It's just a cock, nothing wrong with it.
You didn't choose to have one, so don't feel guilty for having one.
It doesn't change the fact that I'm having very impure thoughts of what I want to do to the other side.
You are?
Of course I am Shauna... 
We could... if you really mean it...
Let me prove it. Lay down.
I wouldn't mind touching her some right now... but I don't think she's ready for that yet...
What are you doing [mcf]?
I'm just thinking about the things we'll do in the future.
Like what?
If you're ever okay with it, there's some things I'd like you to try.
I wish she'd realize that it really isn't a big deal to me...
It's a big deal for her personally, but I don't like her stressing about what I think about it.
What are you doing [mcf]?
Just thinking about some things. Like how I wish you knew that I'm happy with exactly how you are.
But let's just focus on each other right now.
Your cock is so big [mcf]... especially next to me...
Oh! Looks like I missed a lot.
Is it okay for me to be back?
Mhmmm... it is. Thank you [g1].
I assume everything is okay?
Everything is perfect.
Well then don't let me interrupt. Go ahead and let her have it.
Please baby?
Where did that please come from?... I liked it though.
Ohhhhmmm! Fuck!
Ohhh, thank you baby.
Fuck, fuck... mmmmmm...
Are you okay Shauna?
Mhmmm... just give me a little more warning next time.
Wow... give me a second to relax and then you can start... you're so fucking big.
Come on Shauna, be his good girl.
Mhmmm... I'm ready [mcf].
That was a little too quick... I'm going to start out real slow.
Oh fuck [mcf]... MMmmmm...
How does she feel [mcf]?
Tight... very tight. In a very good way.
And he's big... very big.
Fuck [mcf]... Mmmmmm... Keep going...
Fuck me harder [mcf]. You don't have to go easy.
Are you sure Shauna?
Fuck me hard [mcf].
I'll fuck her... but not as hard as I can. Not yet anyway.
OHHH!! Fuck!!
Fuck her baby... cum deep inside of her just like you did me.
FUCK! That's so fucking good!
[mcf]... I can't! You're gonna...
OOHHHHHMMMM FUCK! I'm gonna cum!
Cum with me Shauna!
AHHOOOOHHHMMMMM!!! Fuck...
OHNNN...
Woah! That's a lot Shauna.
What about you baby? Did you give Shauna a lot too?
It feels like it.
I'm not sure how much I had left in me after you, but she got all I had.
Which might not have been a lot...
That was fucking great [mcf]!
Fuck yeah it was... how's your legs?
Not as shaky as last time...
Let me try to sit up...
Oh yeah, they're still shaky...
Take it easy Shauna, we'll get better at it.
My legs are shaky too.... they even got shaky the times you just used your tongue.
You seemed to walk to the bathroom without any issues.
It was harder than it looked.
So... two cumshots to start your day... not bad huh?
Unless you want to make it three...
He has to get ready for practice, he needs to be there soon.
Wait, really? What time is it?
Don't worry baby, you have time. You have about 45 minutes before you need to be there.
Oh, okay... I got worried for a second.
Well then if we're done, I guess it's my turn to use the ladies' room.
Thank you for this morning [mcf]... I'm living my dream with you two.
Thank you Shauna. I'll be in the bathroom soon to take a shower.
Am I allowed to peek now?
Ha, you're allowed to join now.
Deal. See you in there soon.
You two are perfect for each other. You make a great couple.
You could say the exact same thing about us.
Hehe, I guess you could.
So, what did you want to talk to me about?
Oh... it's nothing big. I just don't want to be a downer.
What is it babe?
I miss my sister... I'm worried about her.
I don't care if we fight... I want her to stay with us. I want to know she's safe.
[g1]... come here. Let's lay back down for a moment.
Okay...
I wish Liz was here too. I'm not entirely certain why she isn't.
We've tried to be on her side and support her through this. If she can't respect simple rules then it makes it really tough on us.
She's not a bad person [mcf].
I know, she's just confused... we can't force her to do anything though.
And she's with Willow, I know that's not the most comforting thought but she's safe.
I want to see her... I want to talk to her...
We haven't been apart this long our entire lives...
It's going to be okay [g1].
Maybe we should both try talking to her... at the same time.
Just air it all out. Say whatever we need to say.
Mhmmm... yes please.
I'll talk to her about it at practice. Hopefully we'll have a moment to do it during or after class.
We're going to fix everything [g1]. Don't worry.
Thank you baby... I just want my sister back...
We'll get her [g1].
I have one more question...
What is it?
You said Willow kissed you?
On the cheek. As a thank you for driving her home, she also sat on my lap for a moment.
It wasn't anything, I didn't want it. It was just a weird scenario. She was clearly going through something and I wanted to be there for her.
And she did tell me to tell you that she was sorry for the insults, that she was just trying to be funny and didn't mean it.
You made her apologize for me?
Thank you baby...
Uhh... not exac-
Mwah!
Was that all you needed to talk about?
Mhmm, thank you for listening to me.
Of course.
Now let's go get you cleaned up and ready for practice.
I still can't shake the feeling that [g1] is putting on a brave face for a lot of the things we're going through.
She's doing everything she can for me and I need to let her know how much it means to me...
Hey babe, wait a second.
Huh?
What's wrong?
Nothing is wrong... I just wanted to say something real quick.
[g1], you're the best girlfriend I could've ever asked for. You're kind, honest, caring, insanely beautiful, and you put me ahead of yourself even though I don't ask you to.
I don't take a second of it for granted [g1]. I love every moment with you.
I never want to lose you. I never want to see you care for anyone else like you do for me. I love you so much.
[mcf]...
Awh [g1]... don't cry. Come here.
I never want to lose you either [mcf]. I don't want anyone else.
You're my first and last... and I love you so fucking much.
I want you to know just how much you mean to me. You've been absolutely nothing but perfect.
You've done everything you could do for me. Without questioning it.
None of it goes unnoticed, I don't deserve you.
I don't deserve you either. I feel the same way about you, I believe it when you say you'd do anything for me.
I absolutely would... without a doubt.
Now let's go get in that shower, Shauna's been waiting for a few minutes already.
Mhmm.
I hate seeing her cry... even if it was happy tears.
It was nice to share that moment with her... we used to have those moments many times a day... things have just been so busy lately...
I need to refocus though... it's time for practice, whether I'm ready for it or not.
Around 30 minutes later
Thank you for this morning girls.
Hopefully we didn't wear you out... not too bad at least.
Nah, it's exactly what I needed to wake up and be energized for the day.
So we're your coffee?
Something like that. Give me a kiss before I leave.
Gladly.
Mwah!
Have a good practice [mcf]. We'll see you in class.
Yes you will, I love you Shauna.
I love you too [mcf].
Mwah!
See you soon baby. I love you.
I love you too [g1]. I'll see you girls real soon.
Off to practice... I hope nothing is awkward between me and Harp.
I need to find Liz at some point as well.
It's time to go, Harp said to meet in the actual gym first.
A few minutes later
Oh, looks like it's only Harp in here.
Coach!
Good morning [mcf]. Any chance you forgot about what happened a few hours ago?
No, but I can pretend like I did if that would make you feel better.
No, no. We should talk about it.
But not now, everyone else is about to be here and it's not a conversation to stop halfway on.
That's fair. So we'll pretend like it didn't happen until we hang out later. That sound good?
That sounds perfect.
Great. So what's the plan for today?
For practice? An overall workout to test you guys out.
Then we'll head over to the gymnasium and do some shooting drills.
Which you'll be doing extra of.
Why's that?
Natalie told me about those beers she drank.
Oh, Harp. I'm sorry. I was going to tell you last night but-
She also told me that... which is why I'm letting you off easy with only a few more drills.
It won't happen again.
Haha, sit down.
Huh?
It's not that serious [mcf]. I'm joking more than anything.
She told me she snuck them and that you were there for her the entire time.
I can't be too mad at you for that. Plus I don't want to ruin this morning for her.
What's this morning?
Oh! She didn't tell you?
She said she would be here... not why.
Speaking of her... there's your answer.
Hey [mcf].
Oh my god, Nat...
Surprise! I'm going to be your cheerleader... I mean a cheerleader for you.. your team.
Wow, that's awesome Natalie!
I can't say I was expecting it.
I wasn't either... but that's what me and Zoe were talking about last night.
I drank those beers to celebrate...
You're going to be a great cheerleader.
As long as you wear a cup right?
Exactly.
This way I get to cheer for both my mom and you.
Have you done anything like this before?
Nope... but Zoe said she needed another girl and that she'd teach me everything that I need to know.
I'll help in any way that I can as well.
I'm so proud of her.
She's going to be the best cheerleader out there.
Hmmm, that does work out really well. Natalie is able to experience something new and Harp can still keep a close eye on her.
It works out for both of them.
Mwah!
Mom... stop it...
You two are very cute.
Sorry honey, I'm just so happy for you.
Keep your head to the side for a moment mom.
Really? Right now? Fine...
I think that's my cue to kiss her.
Mwah!
Sorry [mcf]. We don't mean to be gushy in front of you.
I don't mind at all Natalie.
Okay, I'll stop embarrassing her for a moment. I'll let you two talk.
[mcf]. Do some warm ups when you're done talking.
Yes coach.
Thanks mom.
So... yeah. I'm happy I'll get to cheer for you.
I'm happy you'll be cheering for me. Are any of the other girls here yet?
Just Zoe and Emiko... I should be getting back to them.
All right. You're going to do great. Zoe is a good teacher.
Thank you [mcf]. I'll see you soon okay?
Mhmm, see you Natalie. Good luck.
That was a welcome surprise. I think she'll do a great job.
She might can even help me with Liz at some point.
I wonder why Zoe needed another girl though...
Well, Harp said to start with a warm up...
I'm excited to lift some weights again.
[mcf]?
Oh, hey Jasmine. How are you?
I'm doing well. How is Stacy? Last time I saw you two things were a little strange...
She's doing just fine. She's staying with me right now.
Where's the cheerleader uniform?
Oh... uh...
That's what I'm here to talk to you about...
I wanted to be the one to tell you that I'm taking some time off from cheer.
There's just too much going on in my life right now... I need some time away.
It has nothing to do with you or anything.
Jasmine...
You don't have to worry about how I'll feel if you take time off. Do what's best for you.
Sure, I'm a little sad that you won't be cheering for me for a bit... but you doing what's right for you is so much more important than that.
Thank you [mcf]. I'm not sure why I was nervous to tell you.
You shouldn't have been. I'm never going to try to lead you into something that could be harmful for you.
I knew that... I guess I was just excited to cheer for you...
It's a long season, I'd bet you'll find your way back before then.
I hope so... hey...
Would it be cool if I came over to hang out with you and the girls today?
Sure Jasmine, we'd love to have you around. We're going to be pretty busy today but I'm sure at least the girls will be free some today.
Awesome, thank you. Message me whenever I can come over?
Sure. I will. Will Damien be coming with you?
I'll see you later today [mcf].
Oh, uhh. See you Jasmine.
Guess she didn't want to answer that one.
Today's a little rough. We're all pretty busy. Maybe tomorrow?
Oh... okay. I understand. I'll leave you to your workout then... I'll see you in class.
See you Jasmine.
Jasmine is really fond of tight pants... not that I'm complaining.
Just baffles me as to why Damien is acting the way he is...
Ahem...
Oh Damien...
What's up?
I hope he didn't notice me staring at Jasmine a little bit...
Nothing much. Was just about to hit some weights.
That's going to have to wait for a minute.
Why?
Charles is back, he wants to talk to both of us for a minute.
What about practice?
He said it won't take long... it's best just to get it over with.
Fuck... okay. Let's do it then.
Follow me.
I already miss Charles being gone... though Lauren mentioned him being gone added a lot of work onto her...
So at least she's happy... if she's even still here.
Where are you two going?
Charles is back... he wants to talk to us.
We're about to start...
We'll be right back Harp. And we'll make up any time lost.
Hmmmhhh... I wish he would've stayed gone.
Yeah, me too. Sorry coach.
It's not your fault. Hurry back please.
We will.
A few moments later
Charles.
We're both here now.
Who is Charles talking to?
Did you miss me?
Oh fuck, that's the girl from Charles' office.
Yeah, totally. What do you need from us?
A few things. First I want you both to meet my niece. Katie.
Hi.
Hey Katie...
Niece huh? Does that mean she's Ryker's sister?
Actually we've already met the other day.
Oh, you have?
I met him in your office uncle. Before his rally.
I just wanted to let him know how happy we are that he's here.
Oh... all right then. I didn't know.
It's nice to meet you.
The pleasure is all mine.
Me and my uncle are both very happy that you chose WVM.
Yes, we are very happy he's here.
Now if you two could follow us... we have a lot to talk about.
We have to get back to practice Charles.
It won't take long. Come on.
Yep, I feel the same way as Damien. Nothing can ever go simply with Charles.
It really won't.
We just need to run you both through a few things. And we'd like some feedback on a few things.
Can it not wait until later today?
I'm sorry but it really can't.
Follow me.
*whispering* Let's just get it over with... another day... another set of bullshit obstacles.
Fuck, he's right though. We're already here and it's not worth fighting at this point.
Thank fuck that's over for a second.
Huh?
What? You're going to tell me you actually like my uncle?
I didn't say that.
That's what I thought, now let's walk.
Respect points for calling me out.
I thought you might not like that.
Ehh, shows me you're not a pussy. Not afraid to fight back.
I'm not your enemy though.
Thanks for not calling me out...
Why didn't you?
Why would I?
I like it when someone is honest.
Would you have told him why you came into his office?
Hey, I said I like it when someone else is honest. Not myself.
I have a question.
Hmm?
Are you Ryker's sister?
Sadly I am... Older sister.
He doesn't like you.
I don't like him, so it works out.
And I'd tell him that too if he ever showed up to practice.
No one likes him...
But...
I'm excited to finish what we started...
I've thought about it a lot since...
I didn't know you were Charles' niece when I agreed to that.
It doesn't change anything. We truly do want you to be happy here.
And I can do some things that I don't think you'd want Charles to do.
We'll talk about this more later.
But...
Why did you say no to me?
You were a stranger and I have a girlfriend. It wasn't a hard choice.
I've heard you're in an open relationship.
I wasn't at the time.
Aah, so if presented with the opportunity now... you'd change your mind?
Katie...
Think about it. We'll talk about it more later.
Damn, every day there's some new element to all of this.
And if Ryker found out there was anything between Katie and me... who knows what he'd do? It's risky.
Add Charles on top of that as well. I'll admit I like her attitude... but is she worth it?
Not that it matters right now. I just want to get back to practice. And that means doing whatever the hell this is.
A few minutes later
Shit, this is the room me and Bailey were in the other day... it's a lot emptier now.
So what's up Charles? What do you need?
I told you, we have a few things to talk about.
Why do we have to talk in here?
It would be rude of us to not have a proper place to talk.
There wasn't anything wrong with the lobby.
It won't take long Damien.
It honestly won't. Just a few things...
Could they honestly not wait until later?
*Whispering* They could've.
At least she's honest about it... Why is she taking her glasses off?
Like I was saying...
What the fuck is Katie doing?
First off, you have a new teammate on the way. He'll be here today.
His name is Skye. I hear he used to be a woman.
A new teammate?
I don't want to hear of any shenanigans with him. He's your teammate.
Yes sir.
Huh, female to male? I'm excited to meet him.
Secondly, there's some changes being made. Katie will be taking a more active role this year. Taking after her 'ole uncle.
I think Katie and Charles have different ideas of what an 'active role' is... there's no way no one notices her right now.
Katie will be supervising the team for me. Just to keep me up to date on how things are progressing. She'll make a good middle man.
Well, Damien noticed...
Really [mcf]? Haha
Aah! Damien seems into it!
How do you feel about it [mcf]?
Huh? About what?
About Katie taking a role as supervising the basketball team. Just to help out.
Oh... fuck.
Well that depends... what all would that entail?
Katie certainly seems pleased with herself... she doesn't seem to follow Charles blindly so maybe this isn't entirely bad.
Well take a seat, we'll all talk about it.
So I'll be the first to ask... will she be making any decisions that will have an effect on our team?
No, she's just going to give me reports and let me know what's going on. I know I'm not welcome there.
You know we could have an open dialogue about any concerns or changes? That way there isn't any clashing.
We can both get what we want Charles.
We've been talking about that. Getting feedback from the players and making changes is a top priority for us.
We won't do anything without approval from the players first, unless it's necessary.
So you will have a say in making changes then?
What? You want me to be a robot that just sends information Charles' way? I have a brain and an opinion, let me use it.
Doesn't mean I'll have the final say or anything, just advice from the main source.
Is that a problem?
In theory? No. In practice? Maybe.
Come on, it's not that serious. We respect your wishes and your loyalty.
What? Took two hours for you to get latched to Harper? I hope you'd have the same attitude if someone was gunning for my job.
Aah, who am I kidding? Of course you would!
.....
So are we in agreeance? Katie can be a supervisor? 
Fuck it, sure.
Hmmm, is it worth fighting? At least he's letting us know and asking us how we feel about it.
That's got to count for something...
We're in agreeance, but that's if things stay as were stated here.
Congratulations darling! You're now the supervisor!
... thanks uncle.
That's all we should need from you.
But uncl-
Me and the boys have something to discuss. No ladies allowed.
She can stay. I don't mind.
Not a conversation I want my niece hearing.
It's okay, I'll leave...
See? The lady is fine with it.
[mcf], can you find me before you head back to practice? I'll be in the hall.
*Whispering* There's some things I'd like to discuss that I don't want my uncle to hear.
Uhh, sure Katie.
Great, have fun.
Every girl huh?
Shh Damien... it isn't like that.
Haha, you don't have to explain anything to me.
All right, now that it's just us three...
Do you remember what we talked about before I left [mcf]?
Slightly, why?
You agreed to make plans after I got back. So let's make plans.
Tomorrow night, us three.
Doing what?
That's the fun part. Whatever we want. I was thinking we throw a little thing at my place.
Invite some working girls, party a little bit.
Hell I'll even hire some working men for our buddy over here.
Charles!
Oh shit, did Charles just give Damien away?
So that all but confirms what I saw in the locker room...
But I'm not going to let Charles be the one that outs Damien. Even if what he's doing is hurting Jasmine.
He still deserves better than it coming from Charles.
Huh?
What did you say? I couldn't hear that last bit.
That wasn't the greatest cover but at least it gets the conversation off of it. And I can just play dumb for now.
Oh uhh, that we can get some girls and party a bit tomorrow night. Just have fun.
You promised me [mcf].
Did I really promise? Fuck it, he's trying to make something work, so I'll give this a shot.
Sure Charles... just chill with the girls, we can hang out and find something to do.
We'll see about that. I'll call you and tell you when to come by tomorrow.
Sounds good, can we get back to practice now?
Yeah, there's some work stuff I need to get done. I have to redo some documents...
Lauren fucked a few things up that I have to fix. Typical...
It's not worth it... just let his shit slide... get back to practice.
Thank fuck this is over... hopefully shit isn't weird with Damien now.
Are you good Damien?
...
Damien?
[mcf]. I have to tell you something, we need to talk.
We'll talk after practice. This took up enough time okay? I just want to get back there.
Hopefully Damien doesn't take that as me not caring. I just want him to control how he tells me this.
Not in this empty office off the back of Charles' bullshit.
I promise we'll talk after... let's just get back for now okay?
Sure [mcf]... sure.
So... Katie as our supervisor? Honest opinion?
Seems like a future headache, but it's either this headache or another one and things could be worse.
And this headache has big tits and flirts with you so you chose it?
If I remember right you chose her too.
Told you, gunning for the best friend position. And maybe you can flip her to our side and have her work for us. Who knows?
Don't get your hopes up...
Hey... I'll be back at practice in a second okay? I'm going to hit the bathroom.
Oh, that's fine. See you in practice Damien.
Yup, see ya [mcf].
[mcf].
Thank you for agreeing to my niece.
Part of me thought you'd argue about it.
It's how you told us Charles. You let us know and asked our opinion on it instead of trying to just make it happen.
That goes a long way with me.
Good, good. Now get to practice, we need you to be at the top of your game.
You got it.
But first... Katie.
Katie, you okay?
Oh, hey. That went quicker than I thought it would.
And yeah, I'm fine. I've dealt with Charles my whole life. You learn to just go with it at times.
Oh, was Charles in your life a lot as a kid?
Something like that.
What about your parents? Where do they fit into all of this.
Jeez [mcf], you sure are asking a lot of questions.
Oh... sorry Katie, didn't mean to ask anything too personal.
Mmhmm, mmhmmm...
Are you okay?
Huh?
Me? I'm perfect.
Are you sure? That wasn't exac-
So! We need to talk.
Guess anything too far about her is off topic for now.
Fuck it, I won't make this weird.
What about Katie?
Our last meeting, I don't like how it ended.
We were just getting started before we were interrupted.
I have some free time. We should pick up where we left off.
Katie, I have to get back to practice.
We'll be super quick, I promise. You won't last long with me.
Katie...
You're thinking with the wrong head, let me see what the other one thinks.
Oh wow... something is telling me you want this [mcf].
Your cock is growing in my hand...
Katie, do you know where we are right now?
Doesn't that just make it that much more exciting?
Tell me you don't want this and I'll stop.
You didn't know me last time... now you do.
I have some free time. What do you say? How about we make up for last time?
Katie, I have to get back to practice.
We'll be super quick, I promise. You won't last long with me.
Katie...
You're thinking with the wrong head, let me see what the other one thinks.
What the fuck Katie?
Oh wow... something is telling me you want this [mcf].
Your cock is growing in my hand...
Katie, do you know where we are right now?
Doesn't that just make it that much more exciting?
Tell me you don't want this and I'll stop.
Quickly Katie. Where can we go?
Hehe, do you know the party room? Or what used to be the party room?
Yeah, I do.
Of course you fucking do. Why'd I even ask? Follow me there.
This really does have to be quick. Hopefully I still beat Damien back so it doesn't look too bad on me.
Yep, this is the same room I was thinking about.
I wonder what's all happened down here.
Huh, it looks different down here.
Hell, it looks different to me too. A lot less purple than last night.
You said quick right?
Let's take our clothes off then.
We're safe down here right?
Yep, the door is locked.
Oh man, that shirt was not comfortable.
You still like them [mcf]?
They're great Katie.
There we go, completely nude.
So am I... and I did say we had to make this quick.
No time to waste.
Oh! [mcf]!
Fuck Katie, you're fucking wet.
And you're fucking hard.
But what do you think you're doing?
We have to be quick Katie. No time to play around.
Awh, but I really wanted to suck your cock, then you can fuck me.
We really don't have time Katie.
Pretty please [mcf]?
Don't make me beg... just sit down for a moment. It won't take long.
Let me suck your cock [mcf], pleaseeeee!
Okay Katie, fine. Just... be quick.
I know... sit down.
You may not get to fuck me though, you may not make it through my blowjob.
I wouldn't worry about that Katie.
So confident... I could make you cum without even using my hands.
Do it then.
You asked for it.
Mmmmm... damn Katie.
Mhmmmm...
She's a nice change of pace... she's definitely not timid.
She fucking knows how to use her mouth too.
Oh shit, she's not shy with her tongue either.
Fuck, who knows... she may actually make me cum from this.
Mmmm...
Mmm... nothing beats that first touch... where you can feel their hot breath and then two soft lips wrapping around your dick.
Fuck Katie... You're not joking when you say you're good at this.
Mhmmmm...
Are you going to play with the head the entire time?
Uhhh-uhhnnnmmmm.
Fuck.... Katie.
Her mouth is actually like a vacuum right now... feels like she's going to suck my dick right off my body.
MMMMmmm....
Keep going Katie... that's fucking great.
Hnng...
Have to think about other things... I can't cum from this, not yet.
Puppies, old memories... anything.
MMMMmmmmnnnnn....
Oh fuck... I won't last much longer.
Fuck [mcf]... were you even about to cum?
Nope, not at all... not even close.
Mhmmmm... I could feel you squirming and your cock throbbing and fighting. You're not fooling me.
But... I want you to fuck me. So I went easy on you.
Well shit... I'm not complaining.
What are you waiting on? Come fuck me.
Say please.
Pretty please... come on.
Mmmm... don't tease me. Just fuck me already.
And don't be afraid to cum inside... I'm on the pill.
You sure you're ready?
Stick it in me already.
OH! Fuck! Fuck...
Your... cock is so fucking big [mcf].
It feels even bigger inside of me.
I'm not even fully in her... this is as far as I can go.
I'm bottoming out... but fuck it. She's tight and feels great as is.
Fuck me [mcf]!
Fuck, you feel fucking good Katie.
Fuck my tight pussy [mcf].
Make it yours.
Fuck me harder...
Harder [mcf]!
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!
OH FUCK YESSSS!
FUCK ME JUST LIKE THAT!
OH FUCK... KEEP GOING!
DON'T YOU FUCKING STOP!
I'M GONNA!
AHHHNNNNNHHHHHHGGGG!!!
I'm going to cum too... fuck. Where should I finish?
HHnnnngghh!
Fuck [mcf]!
HHnnnngghh!
Fuck [mcf]!
Fuck [mcf]... that was good....
Really fucking good.
Your cock is fucking magical... give me a minute.
I'll let you fuck me again...
I have to go Katie.
Oh right... then soon. You'll fuck me again soon.
Go ahead without me... I'm going to lay here for a minute.
I'll lock the door on my way out.
Thank you. See you soon... real soon.
Bye Katie.
A few moments later
Fuck, as risky as it was I'm glad I did it.
I'm a little tired after... but she felt so fucking good... I'll take the trade off.
I have to get to practice now... before I look too bad.
No Katie... I don't want this. I have to get to practice.
It's not that I'm not attracted to you or anything... but with you being related to Charles and Ryker, it's too risky.
You're making a mistake [mcf].
I don't think I am Katie.
Well then why the fuck are you still talking to me? Fuck off.
Katie...
Go to your precious practice, fucking jerk.
Sorry Katie... I'll see you.
It feels like I've been awake for days now. I didn't sleep much last night and I still have so much to do today.
Just have to take things one at a time.
Yeah, she's always bitching at me for some reason.
Willow?
Oh! Hey [mcf].
How's it going girls? You're both here early.
I have to talk to Lauren...
And I just came with Bailey.
Why aren't you in practice?
Me and Damien had to go talk to Charles.
Oh that sucks, I'm sorry.
Ha, it could've been worse.
It didn't have anything to do with the party last night did it?
No, no. It had to do with the basketball team.
Oh good... But uhh... I should be going.
Oh okay... what do you have to do?
There's just something I have to get done.
I'll see you in class [mcf].
Yeah, I'll see you Rainn...
*Whispering* Thanks for saving me...
From what?
Willow, she caught me alone and I didn't know how to exit the conversation.
I appreciate it... see ya.
I didn't... bye Rainn.
That's kind of fucked up...
Soooo...
Why are you scaring off my friends for?
And what's that about a party last night? Where was my invite?
Zoe and Emiko were hosting it... I think you can understand why they didn't invite you.
It wasn't my party to invite people to... Zoe and Emiko were throwing it.
Aah... fuck 'em. Invite me next time anyway.
Or you could try and be more friendly to them... that might help.
Why would I do that?
Does it not get tiring having everyone think that you're a bitch Willow?
.....
Oh fuck, that was a little too far.
I didn't mean it like that Willow.
I shouldn't have said it like that, I meant that being the 'bad guy' must get tiring.
They aren't bad people and neither are you. There's no reason why we can't all exist harmoniously.
Willow?
First Katie now Willow... today isn't my day.
There's no way I'm the first one to insinuate that she's been acting like a bitch at times.
Are you okay Willow?
I'm fine.
Woah, didn't expect a smile.
I'm just me [mcf]. I'm brash and I don't mince my words. I know that.
Among other things... but that's just who I am. Some people hate me for it but at least I'm not fake.
And think about it, if I was just another one of these girls that fit harmoniously together, would you even be talking to me right now?
Or is it because you know what you're going to get from me?
I'll be honest and real with you, you'll get my honest opinion always. That's got to count for something right?
Of course it does. I think you could go about things in better ways though.
And I think I'd be talking to you all the same no matter what to be honest.
Ehh, but you're a weirdo. You're one of those people that actually help people to help them and not expect something in return.
It sort of makes you seem foolish and I don't understand it but it makes you an easy target so I'm all for it.
Is that what you'd call me helping you out the other morning? Foolish?
No, what you did for me is the only reason you didn't get slapped for calling me a bitch. So it paid off in that way.
Haha, worthy trade.
We should hang out sometime [mcf].
Just as friends... What do you say?
Don't you have a boyfriend?
Huh? No? And I didn't mean it like that. I meant as friends.
You said I knocked out your boyfriend? Ryker?
Hehe, I said that just to piss you off... I heard that you two fought and I needed a favor. I tried to use it to my advantage but you didn't really bite.
That guy is a fucking creep that has hit on me for years. So I figured it was an easy sell.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't relieved that she wasn't dating him.
Oh... You know if you just asked you were more likely to get me to help right?
I realize that now. So what do you say? Down to hangout?
I don't think [g1] or Shauna would be okay with that.
Even after I apologized?
You apologized to me... not them.
If you want to hang out then you'll have to tell them sorry and ask yourself.
That's not something I should be very involved in until you do.
I'll think about it...
Now give me a hug before anyone else shows up.
You'll be in class today right?
Yeah. I'll be there.
See you there then. I have to go find Lauren.
What are you talking to her about?
Can't say... Bye [mcf].
Oh... bye Willow.
Never a dull moment when talking to her...
Fuck... I should've asked about Elizabeth.
Oh well... at least she didn't have any bad news she had to share so things probably haven't changed much.
Guess I'll find out soon though.
Time to go back to practice... hopefully Harper isn't too pissed.
Well... at least the other guys are here.
We'll worry about that later okay?
Yes coach.
Hey Harper.
Hey [mcf]! You actually made it back.
I'm sorry it took so long...
That's okay. I'm honestly shocked I'm seeing you again right now. I figured he'd keep you busy for a few hours.
Do you know where Damien is?
Damn, Damien still isn't back? That's a long trip to the bathroom...
Oh wow [mcf]. He didn't keep you for very long.
We got out as quickly as we could.
Where's Damien?
He said he'd be here in just a minute, he had to use the restroom.
Oh, okay... so what did Charles talk to you about?
Do you really want to know? There's good and bad.
Should I know?
First the good, we have a new teammate on the way. His name is Skye.
Skye? He's here already? I heard he wouldn't be here until next week.
It's what Charles told me. Now for the bad.
There's a woman named Katie... she is going to be watching over us and reporting everything back to Charles.
Sorry coach...
Why are you sorry? I know Katie... She's not that bad.
She's way better than Charles and we both knew he'd try something eventually... this is pretty mild.
I guess you're right. And yeah, Katie does seem like a big improvement over Charles.
Exactly... so you ready to finally hit some weights?
You know I am Harp.
Perfect, we'll get you set up ove-
Uhmmm... excuse me?
Oh, can I help you?
Huh?
It's nice to meet you... my name's Skye.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were behind me. It's nice to meet you, I'm [mcf].
I've seen and heard a lot about you...
What are you here to do Skye?
I heard you were holding tryouts for the team?
Yes we have, but that's already passed.
Oh... I'm a few days late making it here. I just got in last night.
Charles told me to come here and ask. I'm sorry for the interruption.
So you're saying you'd like to join the team?
Yes ma'am I would.
Are you capable?
In what sense? Yes I'm able to and I've played over 6 years of basketball in middle school and high school.
Were all of those on men teams?
No ma'am. The last two years were and I was a starter both years.
Oh, now it makes sense.
He's definitely built... Still curvy but that shouldn't matter... as long as he can play.
What are you thinking [mcf]?
I think we're not in a position to turn people who could possibly play away.
I agree. Would you mind taking Skye and test him out like you did Kenji and Dubaku?
There's no one else capable right now... I have to stay in here and run the others through everything...
Sure coach. Anything for the team.
Head on out to the court Skye. I'll be there in just a second.
Yes sir. I'll be out there.
No 'sir's. Just call me [mcf].
Yes sir... I mean okay [mcf].
Ha, I'll be right behind you Skye.
Thank you [mcf]. You're not pissed are you?
No, like I said. It's for the good of the team. Skye seems polite and hopefully he can play.
I know you were excited to hit the gym though...
Which is why we're going to come back here after class. Sound good?
Ha, not my ideal spot but that sounds great to me [mcf].
I'll be over to watch you two play as soon as I can. I trust you to give me honest feedback on Skye.
Of course I will coach.
I really appreciate you [mcf].
Don't mention it Harp.
Just remember, we're not looking for the best ever. We need players to fill out our bench.
I know Harp. I'll let you know if I think Skye is good enough for that role.
I'll be over there shortly.
A few moments later
Nice court huh?
Absolutely.
So what do I need to do? Tell me and I'll do it.
We're going to play a quick 1v1. Just to get a feel of what you can do. Then I'll run you through a few drills. Sound good?
Hell yeah it does.
You'll need to change first. They keep extra pairs of everything in the locker room. You should also have some things in your personal locker.
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?
Do you really want to try to 1v1 me in jeans?
I do everything in jeans. I'd probably play better in them than I would in anything else.
Sorry Skye, I want to at least give you a chance. Plus you won't be playing in jeans in any actual game or practice.
Haha, I think I could take you on in jeans...
I can take you on in basketball, wrestling, anything. Name it and I'll beat you at it.
Ha, I like the competitive attitude. But you've gotta go change.
Are you admitting that I'd win?
Will that get you to go change?
Hell... probably.
Then sure, let's go with that.
Not much of a fighter are you?
Depends... on something that matters to me I absolutely am. On getting you to change out of jeans... not so much.
I assume you bring more energy when you actually play?
Go change and find out.
Oooh, there we go. I'll be back.
He's tall enough... about the same height as Dubaku and Ayden.
If Skye pans out... how many teammates would that make?
Me, Damien, Lee, Mackey, Ayden, Kenji, Dubaku... and I guess Ryker. So with Skye 9 total?
I'll feel more comfortable when we're around 12 total. Which may happen when I finally meet the old bench players.
I don't even know how many are left... and why is it taking so long for them to be here?
Stars... made up of whatever we can find.
Could they have not picked any other name?
[mcf]!
Hey Zoe... and Elizabeth.
Why is Zoe bringing Liz to me?
Good morning. Have you heard about Natalie yet?
Yeah, she told me this morning about the news. How is she doing?
Not bad, she's still too shy but she's working through it. We're taking a break right now.
Which is why we're here.
She needs to talk to you. I can't have one of my girls going through whatever she's going through.
Thank you for bringing her to me, I need to talk to her too.
I figured as much.
Give me a hug and then I'll leave you two to talk.
What are you doing in here by the way?
About to try out someone else for the team.
Man, Liz looks really torn up...
Well good luck with that, I hope it turns out well.
Who are they?
A new guy, named Skye.
Cool name...
But yeah... send her back to me after you two talk. Take your time.
Thanks again Zoe.
Anything for my girls... but you owe me one.
Agreed, I do. I'll have her back to you soon Zoe. See you.
Bye [mcf].
Hey Liz...
...
I'm glad you wanted to talk to me, I was going to find you this morning.
For what?
[g1] and me talked this morning. We miss you Liz. She doesn't like not having you around and I don't like it either.
We three need to all talk together. Air everything out.
I can't.
Why can't you?
What I have to say will hurt her... I don't want to hurt her.
Can you tell me?
I already have...
I have feelings for you [mcf]... it hurts too much to see you with her and Shauna. There's no fixing that.
Come here Liz.
Huh, she's not hugging me back.
All we can do is be honest with each other. I think [g1] already knows that.
Maybe talking to us both about it will help. It can't hurt to try.
Remember, that's all I'll ever ask of you... is to try.
Oh, there we go.
You mean a lot to me Liz. We've grown up together.
You're smart, beautiful, and you're strong. You've been through a lot and I want to help you in whatever way I can.
I love you [mcf].
I love you too Liz.
When did you want to talk? All three of us?
Either before or after school? Or you can come to where we're staying.
You're not at that house anymore?
No, we're staying with [am]'s old boss Rachael.
How long have I been gone?
Ha, let's sit down. I'll tell you about it.
Okay...
A few moments later
Yeah... that's pretty much it. So we're at her office right now.
Would you rather talk there or in class?
Whichever one works for you Liz.
Is [g1] mad at me?
No, she's just worried about you. And I am too.
Why?
We're in a new place. And we don't know exactly what you're going through.
We just want to know you're safe and we don't want you to hurt.
We both care about you a lot.
Oh, there's a smile.
I thought you'd both be more upset with me...
We're not angry Liz.
And now that things aren't as heavy... I really like the new haircut.
Thank you [mcf]. Willow took me to a salon last night.
I really like it too.
I don't think I've ever seen you with bangs before.
So how has staying at Willow's place been?
She's a lot different when she's at home.
I think you saw that for yourself. I actually relate a lot to her.
That's good.
She told me about what you did for her after I kicked you out. That was really sweet of you.
Did she tell you anything about why she was out there in the first place?
No, she wouldn't tell me anything.
Yeah, me neither.
Still, whatever happened... it's good you were there.
It's probably good you were there too. It had to have been good for her having you there.
I didn't really do anything.
Sometimes all it takes is knowing that someone is there.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
You're kind of giving me credit for crashing at her place though.
And you're not giving yourself enough credit.
Maybe...
So... it's okay if we talk in class? Probably after?
That would be awesome Liz.
Okay, I'm cool with that. Could you let [g1] know so it's not a surprise or anything?
Sure, that's no problem.
Great, guess I'll head back to Zoe now.
Thanks for talking... it's already helped a lot.
You can talk to me anytime. About anything.
But I'll see you in class. Love you Liz.
I love you too [mcf].
I really do owe Zoe. And Liz actually talking without getting defensive was nice.
I just wish it could always be like that.
Yo! [mcf]!
One leaves... another shows.
What's with the outfit?
My locker only had girls clothes in it.
Oh... So are you ready to play?
Of course I am.
But are you never going to ask about me? I've been waiting on it.
I don't want to seem disrespectful.
It wouldn't be. I don't mind talking about it.
It's going to be brought up eventually. I was born a girl but I identify as a guy.
It's why I have boobs... and why they gave me girl clothes.
We'll get you proper gear Skye.
It's not a big deal to me. I don't care what I wear as long as it covers me up.
Want to know anything else? If not we can get started.
First off, thanks for telling me...
No problem. Ask me anything. There's nothing I won't answer.
Uhmmm... if you don't mind me asking. When did you realize you wanted to be a guy?
Pretty much as soon as I started going to school. I never understood girls.
I grew up with three older brothers. My dad treated me like a boy too, he let me do whatever they did.
So when it came to playing with dolls and talking about boys... I just couldn't do it.
Then in highschool, I was asked to play on the boys team. From there I just realized who I really was.
Not to be crude or anything, but do you plan on doing anything to your body?
Like get my boobs reduced? No. There's plenty of guys with bigger boobs than me.
Plus, who is to tell me what my body is meant to look like? I'm who I am.
So fuck 'em if they think I have to look a certain way.
I respect that. And yeah... fuck 'em.
I won't make you talk about yourself... we just met.
And you don't have to explain yourself to me, all that matters is if you can play basketball.
That works with me.
I think you're going to be surprised.
I hope I am.
So... we're going to 1v1? Don't we need a ball?
Yeah, they're kept on the side of the court. Do you mind grabbing one?
Sure.
Was cool of him to be upfront with me about it. Relieves a lot of the weirdness.
I just hope I'm not wasting my time right now. I've been here for 5 days now and have barely trained myself.
We've been too focused on the team for me to worry about myself.
But it can't be like this long term.
Woo! Haven't lost a beat!
Nice shot.
So did I make the team? Haha
Ha... Yep, that's all it takes.
Let's play Skye, it's good that you can hit a three but it'll take a lot more than that.
I know, I know. I was joking.
You're about to see what I'm made of.
Who gets ball first?
You first. No pressure.
You couldn't pressure me if you tried.
So what are the rules? What are we playing to?
11. Like I said, quick game to get an assesment of your skills.
You ready?
Yep, good luck Skye. I'm not going to hold back.
You better not, I don't want to embarrass the star too badly.
Enough talking, start dribbling.
If you miss we switch and I get the ball.
I just won't miss then.
We'll see about that.
I've never seen Skye play but his personality makes me think he's going to try and power through me.
Either by picking a side and just driving or by trying to catch me leaning.
What the fuck...
Nevermind, he's literally just going to try and run through me.
He caught me off guard with that...
Damn, he's going straight for it and has me falling back.
Okay Skye...
Yes! Woo! What now star boy?
Not bad Skye...
I wasn't expecting that... but now that I know you play like that. Don't expect it to work again.
Is that what you say to everyone after you foul them? Do I get a free throw?
If you want one, I did push your shoulder. Won't catch me doing it again though.
Nah, I don't need it. Pass me the ball.
Hmmm... If I was Skye I wouldn't try the same thing twice.
I'd probably try to get me running back and then pull up for a jump shot...
Which I do need to see Skye's jumper... Maybe I'll let it happen.
So 2-0 right?
Yep, but not for long.
We can agree on that.
He's going for the same thing... we'll see if he tries to switch it up.
Okay, good shit Skye.
Not the best jumper but not as bad as Ayden's was...
Fuck!
Oh, so close... my turn.
I usually make that. I had you fooled thinking I would attack the basket again at least...
Mhmmm... So, ready to defend?
[mcf]!
What's up Ayden? What are you doing over here?
Harp told me to come here. They're about to head over here for drills.
Oh, okay... uhhhm. Ayden, meet Skye.
It's nice to meet you.
Likewise, Harp was just telling me that you're going through the trial of fire I had to go through.
Ehh, it's not that bad.
So Ayden, why did she send you over early?
Oh... I fucked up man. I slept in this morning and just got here.
I stayed up too late last night... it's my fault. Sorry.
You don't have to apologize to me, that's between you and coach. Why were you up so late?
Training... watching videos on techniques, memorizing the playbook, all the good stuff.
I just lost track of time... the other day was a real wake up call.
Damn man, yeah... definitely no need to apologize.
Seriously though, won't happen again.
It's okay Ayden, I'm happy you're taking this seriously.
History doesn't get made by those that lay around.
That's the truth... we were just starting a little 1v1, mind just watching us for a bit?
Sure, I'll be the ref or something.
That works with me. It's my ball.
Show me what you've got. I'm ready.
Skye seemed to rely on power to do anything...
Probably grew up being told he would never be strong enough... but we have to break that way of thinking.
And if that takes a little bit of embarrassment... then so be it.
I'll just stare at Skye and react to whatever they do... scoring isn't enough.
I need to send him to the ground.
A quick cut right, get him to bite that way...
He planted his foot, hips turned...
Time for a cut back...
Force him to recover so he can fully change momentum and turn his body back this way.
And as soon as those hips are back facing me...
Another cut to my original side... he won't be able to recover and his momentum should send him to the floor.
Easiest way to beat power...
And finish it with an easy roll in.
Woo! [mcf] for 2 points.
All right, you got lucky...
This is the perfect moment for a 'The sky is falling' joke.
Let's see who is laughing at the end.
Around 30 minutes later.
[mcf]... I'm getting tired, what's the score anyway?
Uhhhh... no clue. I've just been having fun.
How have I been doing?
I'd say you've been just as good if not better than Kenji. And I'd say he's one of our better teammates.
Really [mcf]?
Hey coach.
How did it go [mcf]?
I'm impressed, he plays hard.
Definitely needs work, but then again we all do.
But absolutely good enough to be on the team.
That's fantastic!
All the other boys are on their way here now. We're going to run through some drills.
But congratulations Skye.
Thank you... both. It really means a lot.
Thank you for treating me like just another guy. This felt... fair.
I can't say it was fully expected... you won't regret it.
Of course Skye. That's the last thing I'm thinking about.
You'll get the best out of me every single day. but uhh...
Could I use the restroom before we get started on drills?
Sure you can Skye.
Thanks coach! I'll be back.
Okay... that was a pleasant surprise.
It finally felt like I was playing basketball again... and not just along for the ride.
Is there anything else I should know about?
With Skye? Not really.
I didn't get to see him play at all. Should I manage my expectations at all?
I don't think so... it felt a lot like playing Damien. We lucked out Harp.
I don't know what to say [mcf]...
Thank you for everything, I'm asking more from you than a coach should have to and you haven't complained at all.
We both want to win... so it's whatever it takes to get there.
Damn right.
Are we running drills or relaxing on the floor?
A little of both I suppose.
Ha, how's the new guy?
He could probably beat you in a 1v1.
I'd like to see him try.
I would too honestly.
I was keeping score by the way...
Really? What did it end up being?
You scored 43, Skye scored 19.
We went that long? We were only meant to play to 11.
Well... no rest for the wicked. It's time for drills.
Many drills and some time later
I'm proud of you all. This felt like our first real practice.
Our team is finally coming together. We don't have long to fully fix this ship though.
Everyone needs to be here on time tomorrow... no excuses. It's time we get serious.
It's going to be a long season full of hard times. And we have to be prepared. That starts here.
But on that note, today's hardship is over!
Hit the showers, then hit your classes. I expect to see every face in here bright and early.
I'll see you later everyone, see ya [mcf].
Take it easy Damien.
Thanks again for helping me out today. It was a lot of fun.
And I'm really excited to be a part of the team.
And we're excited to have you Skye. We're going to do great things here.
See you in the morning.
See you Skye.
Hopefully tomorrow's practice is more coordinated, though I'm sure it will be.
Having everyone on schedule should help tremendously.
Hey [mcf].
Yes coach?
Practice is over, I'm Harp.
Did you still want to hit up the gym after classes? You know you don't have to right?
I'm the one that asked you to do this.
I like the gym Harp, part of me wants to do it. Do you not want to?
It's not that I don't want to. It's more that I want to celebrate with Natalie.
Zoe told me she did really well today. I want to let her know how proud I am.
Oh, of course Harp. Be with your daughter.
I'll just find a different gym.
Thank you for understanding... but is it too much to ask for you to celebrate with us?
I don't believe Nat would be a cheerleader today if it wasn't for you being on the team.
What did you have in mind?
Whatever works for you. We'd just like to spend time with you in a place we could celebrate.
It's hard to say right now, what do you say we make a deal?
I'll call and let you know a place as soon as I'm free, if you agree to show up an hour early to practice tomorrow and accompany me in the gym.
That's an easy deal. That sounds perfect to me [mcf].
I'll look forward to your call. Now head on to class, I'd hate to make you late.
There's still plenty of time before classes, but you're right. I'll see you later today Harp.
Bye [mcf]. Good work today.
A shower and a clothes change later.
Hmmm, no Tia in the showers today...
There's still a good chunk of time before class starts as well.
Which is good because I'm fucking tired... I haven't been sleeping very well these last few nights.
[mcf]... Got a minute?
Oh, good morning Lauren. Yeah I have a minute.
It's funny seeing you in clothes now.
Sorry for interrupting your day... I just wanted to ask about the whole therapy thing...
It's no problem... and what about it?
Would you like to start tonight? I can come by your place and we can get this ball rolling.
Uhh... how long would it take?
Not very long at all. An hour tops.
Sure Lauren, I should have an hour free tonight.
Perfect... just call me whenever you're free and I'll come wherever you need me.
Sounds good Lauren... So, Charles is back. Is that helping you out at all?
When he's here I wish he was gone and when he's gone I have way too much work on my hands. There's no winning.
Don't worry about that though, I'm getting through it. I'll see you tonight [mcf].
Bye Lauren. Take care.
A few moments later
Good morning Veronica.
[mcf]? What are you doing here early?
Practice let out a little bit earlier than usual and I didn't take much time in the shower.
Not to sound rude but you know showing early doesn't exempt you from having to stay late right?
Of course Veronica. I'm staying over today.
Good... and don't worry. It won't be too bad.
You won't hear any complaining out of me.
I'm glad to hear it... uhh, there's a few things I have to get in order before class starts but feel free to take your seat.
Sure thing Veronica, just act like I'm not even here.
Give me a hug real quick.
What's this for?
It's just a hug, it's not for anything.
Friends hug friends.
Now take your seat.
Yes ma'am.
She didn't seem to like me questioning the hug... my bad.
I'm strangely excited to have a moment to just sit by myself.
I haven't gotten to do that much recently.
It's nice and warm in here too...
If I'm not careful I might end up taking a nap.
Phew... I really am tired, my entire body is feeling sluggish.
It wouldn't hurt to lay my head down for a moment... I just need to shake my foot or something to stay awake.
Oh yeah... this is what I need.
Just have to focus on my foot so I don't fall asleep.
Focus... focus...
Focus....... foc-
Zzzzz...
Zzz......
Baby?
Baby, wake up.
Huh? I'm awake.
Awh, you look so tired.
Practice that rough?
No, I just haven't slept as much as I'm used to and my body is letting me know about it.
I'm sorry baby, we wouldn't have woken you up this morning if we would've known.
No, no. Never apologize for that. I enjoyed that very much.
So did we... but your sleep is important... and we just woke you up again.
Not as fun this time around though.
Sadly not... but I'm happy to see you both.
And we're happy to see you.
How was your morning?
Uneventful. [am] was still asleep when we left so it was pretty quiet the whole time.
But we did come up with a few ideas for surprises...
Any hints?
Nuh uh, you'll have to wait and see.
I'm excited to find out. I love you girls.
We love you too.
Hey [mcf].
Oh, sorry Stacy. I didn't realize you were behind me.
It's okay, I just wanted to tell you good morning.
And to thank you again for meeting my mom last night.
Good morning to you too Stacy. And Margaret seemed like a lovely woman.
Did you manage to get any sleep after?
Not really... but it's okay. I don't usually sleep very much so I'm used to it.
Guess we're both tired today then.
I'll keep you awake if you do the same for me.
Ha, deal.
Babe, are you still staying after class?
Yeah, I'm not sure exactly how long that will be either.
Hopefully not too long...
Yeah, hopefully not.
Where did Shauna go?
She's just grabbing another chair. There were only three here.
Oh, yeah... I forgot about that.
Hehe, you're really sleepy. I can tell.
I'll help you stay awake through class... don't worry.
You all ready for class?
I know you all missed out yesterday. But it was mainly another introduction day.
We went over what we plan to achieve over the course of the year and what realistic expectations are for the class.
Is that what I'll be making up?
Heh, Not really...
Being completely honest with you... you're only having to stay over because you're the only guy in the class.
I want everyone to know that you have to follow the same rules as them and that you're not getting special treatment.
I know that seems weird seeing as it's only you being punished...
No, I get it. It's to show everyone and set the example for it.
Thank you for understanding. So, ready for class?
Yes ma'am.
We're ready.
Good, let's get started then.
Good morning everyone. Today marks our first lesson into communication.
Every kid is taught that everyone is different. That every race, culture, and belief were all meant to be treated with the same respect.
Yet far too commonly that lesson falls short when it comes to communicating.
Everyone wants conversations to go a certain way. Most commonly either through emotions to build a relationship or facts to gain information.
Identifying what the other person wants to achieve from the conversation is vital.
And to do so, the first thing we have to learn to do is listen to them.
Halfway into the lesson later
Hmm... the beginning was pretty interesting but she's been repeating the same idea just in a lot of different ways.
I guess it's really important to her lesson plan that we understand this.
Psst...
Not falling asleep are you?
Not yet... if it keeps going this way then maybe.
I know what you mean... want to play a little game?
We should probably pay attention babe.
We'll just play for a second, we won't miss anything.
Okay, what do you have in mind?
Let's look around the room... tell me what you think about the girls.
Uhh, [g1]. That's a bit too far don't you think?
It's just passing the time. I'll tell you what I think about them too.
Okay, if you really want to then we can do a few. Who first?
No one specific. Just start on one side of the room and work your way to the other.
Okay... what do you want to know about them?
Just what you think about them... if you're interested in them.
It would help a lot to know what girls you're into.
Okay, sure. We can do that.
Still feels a little strange but it'll help pass the time.
How do you feel about Stacy?
Could you ever view yourself in a relationship with her or is she more of just a friend to you?
I wouldn't say I'm actively looking for something with her. There's some things I have to figure out first...
But there's no reason for me to say no. She's sweet, affectionate, cute, and kind.
I feel the same way about her. I'm happy she's been staying with us.
And I don't think it needs to be said but I think she really likes you, so I'm happy you like her too.
Stacy is cool, she's a lot of the things I would look for in a girl.
But I don't know, I can't see myself being in a relationship with her.
I think you two would be really cute together... but if you're not feeling it then you're not feeling it.
There's Bailey... but I think we already know the answer to that one.
Is she coming over today? I already talked to Shauna about it... she said she was fine with it as long as anything uhh... more private happened behind closed doors.
I'll talk to her after class. But yeah, I think she'll be coming over.
And of course, if anything happens we'll be respectful of any rules set in place.
We'll talk about it later, I personally don't mind...
There's Bailey... but didn't you already say that you just wanted to be friends with her?
Yeah, I really like her. It's just not like that.
Can I ask why?
A few reasons, I just can't see myself being intimate with her. That added onto the fact that she cheers for the team... it just sounds risky.
She's really cute though.
Ha, she is... she just isn't what I'm looking for though.
Okay... what about Kimmy?
Is she still mad at you? Did you ever find out why?
We're on good terms now. I'll explain it all later but I'm going to help her out with something.
And yeah... I think I'm interested in her. At least what I've seen so far.
I've only had a few interactions with her. But from those I think I like her.
Mmmm... well, maybe try making a move when you help her with whatever?
I'm barely on her good side right now, it's a little early for that.
I don't really know anything about her yet. I'm excited to get to know her though.
She's got a lot going on and I'm more than happy to help her through anything... but I don't see it ever going past where we are now.
I think me and her have a lot in common but I also don't think we're compatible at all.
I haven't really gotten to meet her yet. I've heard good things about her though.
One I'm personally very curious about... Jasmine.
[g1], that's Damien's girl.
I know, it's not that serious though, we're just playing a game.
Imagine Jasmine was single. Would you want to date her?
If she was single then yes. I think she's a very beautiful woman with a big heart.
Mmmm... I thought so. She deserves better than Damien [mcf].
That's for her to decide. And that's a bridge I'm scared to cross.
You know it's coming right?
Yeah, it certainly feels that way.
What is she writing? There really isn't anything to take notes on... at least not anymore.
I honestly can't say [g1]. I just can't think of her in that way when she's in a relationship with Damien.
I understand babe... I think you're exactly what she needs. But that's up to you two.
What is she writing? There really isn't anything to take notes on... at least not anymore.
Oh! What are you doing babe?
Nothing baby, I just wanted my hand right here.
Uh huh... and why's that?
I was just checking to see if you were as excited as me.
How excited are you?
Talking about this is fun [mcf]...
Let's keep going.
Who next?
Nothing baby... I just think it's sweet.
What is?
You're sitting here telling me all these beautiful women aren't for you.
I know you don't mean it that way... but it makes me feel good.
You know you're special [g1]. Not many girls could ever compare.
I love you
I love you too.
But there's surely at least another girl here that you like.
Let's keep looking.
Who next?
Oh, she looks like she's asleep. But what about Penelope?
Damn, she's a lot like me right now... sleepy.
I wonder how she feels about that kiss last night...
She went running before I could really say anything.
Yeah, I like her. She reminds me a lot of Shauna.
Really? I heard Shauna talk about her.
Once again I don't really know much about her. But I'll make an effort to learn.
She reminds me a lot of Shauna...
Really? I heard Shauna talk about her. So you're into her?
She's nice. She's someone I hope Shauna can get to know. They've been through a lot of the same things.
But she's a bit too much for me... she's read a lot of interviews from me and already knows a lot about me.
It feels strange.
Oh yeah, I can see that being weird. Then again it's kind of cute.
What about her? I don't think I've learned her name yet...
It's Carly. And I haven't had a real conversation with her yet so I really can't say.
I'm sure she's a nice girl.
I think so too. But I have no clue in all honesty.
All right, so next... uhh...
Oh, just skip them babe.
I wonder what they're whispering about.
It's okay... you can say.
[g1]...
Like you said, they're off limits. I'm not thinking about them like that.
I don't like limiting you...
You're not... in any way. I promise.
Also I meant to tell you, I talked to Liz. I don't know if you've already heard but she agreed to talk after class.
She did? Thank you...
Yeah, she actually came to me. She's hurting just like you [g1].
Not for much longer.
What are you two talking about?
About our plans for after class.
Oh? What are they?
Excuse me.
Please pay attention you three.
Sorry Veronica. You have our attention.
Thank you.
At least now I'm excited for after class.
I am too [g1]. We should focus before we get in trouble though.
True.
The rest of class later
Okay everyone, that should do it for today.
You're free to leave, I'll see all of you tomorrow morning.
Finally... I don't mind class.
Just not when I'm half asleep.
Hey [mcf].
Hey Kimmy. How are you?
I'm tired... but I wanted to ask.
Did you still want to show me that house today? If you're busy it can wait.
Of course Kimmy. I just have to stay with Veronica and make up for yesterday. If I send you the address could you meet me there later?
Thank you! Yeah. I can meet you there. Just let me know when.
Will do Kimmy. I'll see you soon.
Bye [mcf].
It's really nice seeing her smile.
[mcf]?
Hi.
Hey Bailey. Where did those glasses come from?
Oh, I sometimes wear them in class. My eyes started to hurt halfway through.
Do you like them?
They look great Bailey.
Thank you.
So what's up?
Just killing some time, they're doing some work to the diner so it's really loud there right now.
Just come and hang with us for a bit.
What's happening?
Bailey doesn't want to go home yet. So I said she could come hang out with us.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I have to stay with Veronica but I'll be there soon.
Are you sure [g1]?
We'd love to have you over Bailey. You're more than welcome.
Thank you so much [g1].
What's this about hanging out?
Hey Jasmine, you still coming over?
If you'll have me.
You're always welcome to come over anytime.
That's sweet of you. Yeah, I'd love to come by.
I have to give Rainn a ride home first... I know she'll want to take a nap.
So I'll be there soon.
Something is wrong with her.
You leaving now?
Yeah, so I can get it out of the way.
Let me walk you out.
What's wrong Bailey?
It's dumb... just me being selfish.
I was hoping that when we hung out that we'd have some alone time.
We will, I promise. [g1] and Shauna already agreed. So I better see you there. Okay?
[mcf]... I'm excited. I've been thinking about you all class long.
I'm excited too.
I'm going to go home and get ready...
We're going to have fun.
Yes we will. I'll be home as quickly as I can.
Don't make me wait too long.
I want it as badly as you do Bailey, so don't worry about that.
Good... I'll see you soon. Very soon.
Bye Bailey.
You leaving now?
Yeah, I'll be by your place soon. Bye everyone.
See you soon Bailey.
Me and [mcf] are going to stay and talk to Elizabeth.
If you two want to go ahead and take Stacy and head to our place then we'll meet you there.
Are you sure? We can wait.
It's fine. It may take a minute, I'm not sure.
If you change your mind then just give me a call.
I will. Bye Jasmine.
Bye everyone.
Guess that includes me. Do you need me to do anything?
What do you mean?
While I'm home. Do you need your clothes washed or anything?
Don't worry about that Shauna, I'll take care of it.
I'm just offering. You know I can-
Come here.
Mwah!
If you keep shutting me up with kisses we're going to have some problems.
Yeah? What are you going to do about it?
You'll see. Bye [mcf], I love you.
I love you too Shauna, be safe getting home.
You know it.
Excuse me.
I hear you're going to be taking my friend away.
Hey Willow, and that's the hopeful outcome.
Well let me apologize to [g1] real quick. I don't want her to hold me from talking to Elizabeth at all.
Oh, I mean. Yeah, go for it.
Did I hear my name?
Yes you did.
Oh, Willow... it's nice to meet you.
I won't bullshit you [g1]. I said something I regret saying the other day. I didn't intend to hurt your feelings.
I didn't mean it and I was just trying to make Rainn laugh.
In fact I think you're attractive, and I was jealous of your boyfriend.
And for all those reasons, I apologize and I hope we can start over.
Oh... Willow. Thank you.
So? Apology accepted?
Yes. Thank you for apologizing.
What about you [mcf]? Do you accept my apology?
It's your girl, I figure the apology extends to you as well.
I appreciate the apology and honesty Willow. Apology accepted.
Cool, I'll talk to you soon then. I'm out of here.
Oh, bye Willow.
Bye. Oh... if Elizabeth needs anything that she left at my place just call me and I'll bring it.
Will do, thanks Willow.
Did you ask her to do that?
Kind of, I told her that if she ever wanted us to be friends with her that she would have to apologize.
Well that was nice of her...
Guys...
Oh, Liz. You came out of nowhere.
I want to apologize too... I fucked up [g1]. I let my emotions control me again.
Liz... it's okay.
It's not... I shouldn't have called you those names. You know I didn't mean it.
Oh...
It's okay sis. I forgive you. It's nothing we can't fix.
[g1]... please just be mad at me. I deserve it.
No, you're my sister and you're hurting. I'm here for you.
I'm so sorry... I should've never called mom.
Don't worry about that right now.
All I care about is knowing that you're safe and that you're happy.
What was that about calling their mom?
Come back home Liz. We can work through whatever. You can yell at me, you can do whatever. Just please don't leave.
[g1]... I can't promise anything. I'm not perfect.
You don't have to promise or be perfect. I just want you to keep trying.
Please... for me.
Okay... but we have to talk. About a lot of things.
We can do that there. Tell me whatever you have to tell me Liz. I won't judge you.
Just please come home.
Are you sure that's okay with you [mcf]?
Am I worth the headache?
Damn right you are. Come home Liz.
Thank you baby.
I honestly don't deserve your two's forgiveness.
You deserve more than you think Liz.
If you two don't need me then you can go ahead and head home.
Go ahead and talk about whatever you two need to, and if you need me for anything I'll be home soon.
Are you sure?
Absolutely. You two have got this.
Can I have a hug before we leave?
I owe you [mcf].
Not many people get tenth chances.
I'll do my best not to let you down again.
I know you will.
Bye [mcf].
Bye Liz.
I can't help but feel that this is temporary.
I've seen it too many times, Liz is good for a few days then we're right back to her hating everyone.
Maybe this is the time it lasts?
I'm sorry, we were all meant to talk and I kind of took it all on myself.
That's totally fine.
I couldn't help myself... I just really wanted to hug her.
You're precious [g1]. Get home safe okay? I'll be there as soon as I can.
I'll be safe. I promise. I love you.
I love you too.
Mwah!
Bye [mcf]
Now just to get through this last bit of class.
At least Veronica is cool. This shouldn't be too bad.
Are those Jasmine's notes? She must've forgotten them. I should bring them to her.
Oh...
That's what she was writing the whole time...
Looks like she wrote it until her pen gave out.
Should I take it with me?
I'll take it. She's clearly hurting more than she's showing.
She needs to talk to someone about it. I can confront her with it.
I shouldn't. It's not a good look for me if she finds out I took it.
I'll just flip it over so hopefully no one messes with it.
Phew, I think that was all of them.
Yep, I believe so.
Damn, Veronica has a nice figure... and she's not wearing shoes again... I wonder why?
Sir?
What were you doing?
Uhh...
I was just thinking about why you don't usually wear shoes... it's not a big deal though.
Fuck, [g1]'s game made me want to just check everyone out I guess.
Oh, yeah... that.
My bad...
I don't like wearing shoes. They hurt my feet.
Especially the ones I tend to wear to work.
So when I'm in my own classroom I like to be bare foot.
That's totally reasonable.
But I'm a little tired of this classroom today. What do you say I throw some shoes on and we head to the park?
Really? I'd much prefer that.
I figured so. Let's go.
That's exactly what I need. A little fresh air and sunshine.
A few minutes later
Wow, it's nice out here today.
It's easy to forget how beautiful outside can be.
Let's sit for a moment.
Sure.
So how did you like class today?
Today was a little rough, I didn't sleep well last night so it was a little hard to focus today.
I hope that's not a common problem.
It's not. Just a one time thing.
So, how do you think I am as a teacher?
I don't have much to go off of but you've done well so far. I enjoy your class.
I think you as a person aren't bad either. I don't mind spending time with you in a park at all.
That's all very sweet of you. You're not bad company either.
Thank you Veronica.
So is there anything I should know about yesterday?
We went back over a lot of it today. Do you have any questions?
No, I think I have a pretty solid grasp on everything.
Oh, how's Nathan and his mom doing?
He bugs me everytime I see him asking if he can hang out with you again.
Set it up and I'll be there.
I still have to talk to his mom about it. But it really warms my heart knowing you want to see him again.
I still owe you for doing that the first time.
You don't owe me anything.
How did I know you would say that?
It's what I do.
It's very charming...
Carly?
Huh?
Oh, hey there Carly.
She seems to be taking that weight loss thing very seriously... that's cool.
Still hiding from me though...
Oh... Bye Carly!
Have a good day!
That poor girl...
What about her?
Oh, nothing. She's just been through it recently. Seeing her run here is a very nice surprise.
If I may ask, what's wrong with her?
It's not my place to say [mcf]. I don't have all the facts anyway.
It does make me feel lazy though.
Would you like to walk some?
Sure, we can do that.
I wonder what all that was about... I haven't heard anything about Carly.
I just figured she was a shy girl.
Don't worry, I won't keep you for much longer.
It's just nice to have some company.
We can do this anytime you want to Veronica. I'm having a good time.
I'm very glad to hear it, now let's walk.
She's a very beautiful woman... why does she sound lonely?
Not my place to ask... so I shouldn't worry about it.
I should just try and give her an enjoyable time.
So what would you like to talk about?
One walk and conversation later
Phew, that was a walk... my feet are sore.
I just don't think you were made for shoes...
Yeah... me neither...
Add it to the long list of things I wasn't made for.
Woah, that sudden mood change.
Are you okay Veronica? Did I say something?
No, I just get to thinking about things on walks...
How did I end up here? This isn't my passion.
Oh...
You have your whole life ahead of you kid... never settle.
That's the best advice I can give you.
Hey Veronica... it's okay.
What's got you feeling this way?
I don't think I'm happy.
With what exactly? If I can help in any way please let me know.
I need to go...
Veronica... wait, we can talk through some of this.
Just vent a little.
I can't right now [mcf]...
Wait, wait... talk to me. What happened?
This is the first time I've actually taken a step back from everything...
I've been so caught up in it all that I didn't realize how sad I am...
I don't want to go back...
It's okay Veronica. Do you honestly hate it that much?
I don't know... I may just be stressed out...
Maybe... and even if you aren't. You're still an intelligent young woman with her entire life ahead of her.
This job isn't who you have to be.
You're not stuck...
I think you may just need some rest. A good night's sleep.
Yeah... you may be right.
I don't really see myself making it through the year at this rate... but being emotional in front of my students isn't going to help anything.
I really don't mind Veronica.
I know... and that makes it worse.
Do you need a ride home?
You're leaving? And no... I don't have to go far from here.
Yeah... I'm going to head out. I really do need to lay down. I'm sorry if that's rude.
No, I understand.
Good, I'll see you in class tomorrow.
Yep... right on time. Bye Veronica. I'm only a phonecall away if you need me.
Well shit... it was a really nice time until that happened...
I wonder what got to her? Maybe she is just stressed. Not like I can judge on that.
Guess it's time to text Kimmy. And I might as well go ahead and text Bailey as well.
Oh that's right... I messaged Anna this morning. I have a message from her.
That's so great to hear!
I'll message Rachael right away and have her set it up!
I'm so happy to hear that you want to see from me again.
I had a really great time with you Anna. And I'm looking forward to seeing you again.
I think we'll both enjoy the time very much. I'm going to call Rachael. I'll message you soon. xoxo
Oh, a message from Alexis...
Why didn't I go to college myself?
Cold feet. Got scared and decided against it. So I'm still just working at this restaurant.
Do you regret it?
I'm not sure yet... it could be leading to something great...
What are your plans now?
To go where my heart takes me.
My boss will be mad at me if I'm on my phone for too long. Message me later. <3
Hmmm... I wonder what she meant by that.
I'll message Kimmy first.
Hey Kimmy... are you good to go look at that house now?
Yes please... I want out of this room for a bit. Where is it?
I'll send you the address... I'll see you there soon.
I'll be there real soon.
Now to text Bailey.
Hey Bailey. I'll be headed home soon. Are you still coming?
Absolutely... I just have to do a few errands first and then I'll be there. Is that okay?
That works out perfectly. I'll see you soon Bailey.
You'll see a lot of me soon... be ready. ;)
Trust me, I'm ready.
See you [mcf].
I believe that's all I had to do. Guess it's time to meet up with Kimmy.
I'm only a few minutes away... I hope she'll be happy with the house.
A few minutes later
There she is... and I like her outfit.
You like the place Kimmy?
Oh, you got here quicker than I thought you would. Is the park that close to here?
Closer than you think it is. I plan on jogging there in the mornings sometimes. Any chance I'll see you there?
There's a good possibility.
Good, so... have you peaked through the gate to check out the house?
I was about to. I just got here myself.
Are you excited?
Of course I am. But my family are the ones that are going to be super excited [mcf].
They won't have to stay in that crappy motel anymore.
Are they here?
No, I told them I'd come check it out and I'd call them if everything went okay.
Do you think something is going to go wrong?
It's not everyday someone offers you a house for nothing. I'm skeptical.
Well let's put that worry to rest. Head on inside.
It's nice right?
Wow [mcf]... It's really nice... too nice.
The door should be locked. Let me open it.
I'm excited... how many rooms does this place have?
Plenty. As many as you'll need and then some.
Huh... the door isn't locked... did I forget to lock it when I left?
Was I even the last one to leave?
What's wrong [mcf]?
Uhh... nothing, just stay behind me when we walk in.
Okay?
Hmmm, nothing seems out of order...
*Indistinct whispering*
What the hell [mcf]? Is someone in here?
What the fuck? Who is in our house?
Who could it be? A burglar? Or just someone looking for a house to squat in?
Stay behind me Kimmy.
Fuck... it sounds like a guy's voice... and it sounds like it's coming from the next room over...
I won't find out anything standing here...
*Whispering* Just get through it.
Damien?! What the fuck are you doing here?!
[mcf]?? Oh fuck!
Oh fuck is right! Why the hell are you in my home?! How did you get in?
[mcf] I can explain.
What's going on [mcf]?
Stay behind me Kimmy... I don't know.
Is that him I hear?
Honey... you're home!
I've been waiting a long time to meet you.
What the fuck... Ryker? Why are the two of you in my home?
Not yours... mine. We were just letting you stay here.
But clearly you didn't appreciate that.
So how can we help you?
What the fuck is going on Ryker?
Hi Kimmy... you seem a little upset.
Men are talking right now, do you mind waiting outside?
I don't believe there's any seats for average swimmers here.
Unless you want to sit on my lap, then we might could make something work out.
I want to knock this motherfucker out again...
I don't know what's going on though. There may be more people in the house.
I need to see what's going on before I let my temper take control of me.
You're a fucking disgusting pig Ryker.
I hope you choke on all of that shit you talk.
So you'll be waiting outside then?
Fuck you.
Hmmm... Damien. Take her outside.
Boss...
I said to fucking take her outside. Do not make me repeat myself.
Do I have to make a phonecall?
No sir...
That's what I thought.
Now take her outside... stay out there with her. I need to talk to Mr. [mcl].
Yes sir.
What are you trying to do [mcf]?
I thought you were trying to help me... but you just brought me here to be made fun of by captain shitface.
No Kimmy. I promise I didn't know they would be here. I'm as mad as you are right now.
Just go outside. Let me talk to him and figure things out.
If you don't trust me then you can leave. But no matter what I'll have a place for your family to stay tonight.
Even if it's with me.
Fine... but if you fuck me over... you'll regret it [mcf].
You're one tricky son of a bitch [mcf].
Damien... I don't know what the fuck is going on but you better not-
Don't listen to him Damien. He's not your boss. Take the girl outside... but don't hurt her.
And you Damien... I thought you were one of the few good guys here... You're just another one of them.
You no spine having bitch. Jasmine should've ditched your ass months ago.
Come on Kimmy...
This is such a fucking joke.
Not the cleanest of introductions.
Women... am I right?
So what? You bring her here to bang her or something? You can do better than her [mcf]...
...
No comment? Oh well.
Now that that's out of the way... let's take a seat.
Hmmm... he turned his back to me and he's made it incredibly easy for me to try something.
I don't feel like he's that dumb... maybe he's just that cocky?
Or he wants me to try something. He's already tried to claim assault once... and this time he would be right.
Sit down star boy. It's time you realized a few things.
I'm good. I'd rather stand.
It's really in your best interest to sit down. Come on.
Don't you want to know why I'm here? Why Damien is here?
That only happens if you sit down. Or else I'll have to kindly ask you to get out of my house.
Fuck it... I'm already here. And I want answers.
Good, good. I've been trying to have this conversation for a while now.
First time was when you were in the nurse's room after Harper's daughter landed on you. I was on my way when that girlfriend of yours showed up.
Then I was told that you were walking down the street by yourself at night. I thought luck was on my side until I arrived and that redheaded girl was talking to you.
I tried to get her to leave and she refused. I tried to scare her off and she refused. I tried to creep her out and she refused.
Then after all of that I finally get you back to my house and next thing I know I'm waking up on the floor and you're nowhere to be found.
That fucking bitch.
Deep breaths... stay calm. He'll pay for these comments later...
Why did you make me bring Stacy to meet you and Charles? And why did you try to talk to her at the motel?
To get under your skin. To see how you'd react.
To learn your weaknesses. And I learned a big one.
It was also to see where Charles' fell... To see if he would side with me or you.
See... I had a good thing going. I had everything set up and good to go. Then you decided to come here.
I convinced Charles to hire Harper... I told him that the players on the bench were making the starters worse.
I got the playbook altered several times. Everything was falling apart and it was perfect.
I had the perfect scapegoat, the perfect follow through, it was just the perfect plan.
Why? Why do all of that?
Do you know what the betting line is like when a team with no wins goes against one of the best teams in college basketball?
Do you know how much larger that betting line is if the team goes completely defeated two years in a row?
One win against those teams and everyone is swimming in money. All it takes is a little bit of convincing.
And then you show up...
I don't think you can be bought... not like Damien.
In fact I don't know what to do with you. 
What if you just weren't here? You came here because of that weirdo Shauna right?
Ryker... you better watch your fucking mouth.
Hmm... let me finish [mcf].
It's you, that girl with the big eyes, the freak, and big tits right?
One more fucking word Ryker... I'll send you through the fucking wall.
Your face is getting all red [mcf].
You're a lot like your dad. You know that?
What the fuck do you know about my dad?!
I looked into your past. Your father had anger issues.
You should really see someone about that...
Fuck... he's right... I was about to lose it.
What do you say? I'll try to get you all transfered to another school. It would've been easier if I talked to you sooner but I still think it could happen.
It would be a lot easier if there weren't people talking about your life to hundreds of thousands of people every single day.
But that doesn't mean it's impossible.
What do you say?
You haven't explained why Damien was here yet.
It's very rude not to answer me [mcf].
You told me you'd explain it to me. I'm not answering until you do.
He's my employee.
What do you employ him to do?
Whatever I ask him to do... hmmm.
Why does he do that?
He has a lot of the same weaknesses you do. Including a sick mother... very easy to manipulate.
We pay the medical bills, he does a little spying, gives me info. Fair trade.
I don't believe you.
Are you calling me a liar?
Not really, I think you're hiding the real truth behind a half true answer.
Want to hear it from the man himself?
Gorg! Come here!
So there was someone else... and his name is Gorg.
Ryker knew I was coming here.
Yes boss? Is it time?
No, go get Damien. He's outside.
And watch the girl he's with. Don't touch her.
Yes sir.
It's a good thing I stayed calm. I'm not sure if I could take on Ryker, Damien, and this guy.
He raised a good question about getting me to transfer though. All of this could be made so much simpler.
But then Harp would be stuck with them... unless I could get her in the deal too. But who even knows if she would agree?
And Rachael moved her business here... things are already in motion.
Didn't expect him huh?
Actually I did. Maybe not the red beard... but I was definitely expecting him.
Not as dumb as you look then.
I mean you can't blame me for assuming. You've fallen for pretty much everything else.
That guy right there being the worst one you've fallen for so far.
Damien... buddy. Our friend here doesn't believe you've been following his every move.
...
Go ahead don't be shy. Tell him about how you've stabbed him in the back multiple times.
Tell him about how after you met him you told him that you would be resting. Only to then follow him around all day.
...
I said tell him!
I'm giving you a chance to put a positive spin on it... how I put it won't be so kind.
...
I've been following you around [mcf]. It's why I'm rarely available.
Why Damien?
I had to.
I don't like that answer... what about you [mcf]?
He didn't even talk about any of the fun stuff.
My personal favorite being that pool date you were meant to have.
I made him miss it so he could watch you be with his girl.
Sadly you're a goody two shoes so nothing happened... but it's the thought that counts.
Isn't that right Damien?
...
Heh, even I won't make you answer that one.
I'm going to be on my way. You think about what we talked about [mcf].
I'll ask you how you feel tomorrow... sleep on it.
And my key is sitting on the dresser over there. It's my only one. Give it to Kimmy.
I don't need this place. And I won't be back to bother her.
Really Ryker?
Call it an act on good faith that you'll do the right thing. Kimmy isn't a part of our problem.
I'm glad you see it that way.
See you tomorrow [mcf]. I'll leave you and Damien to talk.
Yeah... I guess you will.
Oh... and a little heads up. Damien isn't the only one watching you. And whoever else is doesn't work for me.
What the hell?
So watch your back... see you around [mcf].
That's surely just him trying to get in my head.
Are you okay Damien?
Yeah... I'm sorry [mcf].
I know... and we're going to talk about it.
But we should check on Kimmy first.
Yeah.
So much for trying to be my best friend... but I don't think it had anything to do with me. He's just doing what he has to do.
If I had to spy on someone to make sure [am] was okay then there's no doubt that I'd be doing it.
I mean I'm pissed at Damien... but I'm going to hear him out.
No matter what I won't be able to trust him from here on. Ryker is a fucking tool.
I'm not excited about Kimmy living here now. I'll leave the decision up to her though.
Kimmy? Are you okay?
Did Ryker and... Gorg leave?
Why did you bring me here?
I was so excited... I told all of my family...
Now I have to go back to the motel and tell them all that I was wrong...
No you don't Kimmy.
What do you mean?
Ryker was just trying to get to me. This didn't have anything to do with you.
I'm sorry it went down this way but it should be over. Ryker left his key and said you're free to stay here.
What if he comes back?
Then you call me instantly and I'll be here as quickly as I can.
I don't think he'll bother you though. I would still stay on alert for the time being.
You didn't have to agree to anything did you? He's not making you do anything?
Do you really think I would ever work for him Kimmy?
I don't know what to think anymore [mcf].
Well I'll tell you what I think then.
I think you should go inside and check out this house. If you think it's worth the potential trouble then call your family and have them head on over.
Me and Damien need to talk alone for a second anyway.
Thank you [mcf]...
And I'm sorry Damien. I didn't know the situation you were in. I shouldn't have called you those names.
I wish I hadn't.
It's okay...
Everything is going to be okay. But Ryker can still inhale a dick.
You need to make things right.
I know...
Listen to him okay? He explained what's going on to me.
Things aren't as bad as they seem. Just go easy on him.
I will Kimmy.
I'll be inside if you need me.
I'll be in there in a second.
So, where do we start?
I didn't want to do it [mcf].
I only told him what I had to... the absolute bare minimum.
What all did you tell him?
Pretty much just where you were and where you were going to be.
Every day?
Yeah... everyday. Not all the time though. There were some nights that I didn't 
I mainly only saw you when you were heading somewhere else. I didn't really try to spy on you when you were at home.
And me doing that wasn't personal. One of my parents is sick. I work for Ryker and in exchange she doesn't have to worry about medical bills.
I'm sorry to hear that Damien. How bad is it?
Bad.
He told me we're moving onto other things. I won't have to watch you anymore.
And... about that day when we were meant to have a date at the pool.
What about it?
Thank you for being there for Jasmine. I heard everything you said to her.
She's at your place now right?
Yeah, she's with [g1] and Shauna. But Damien... I have to ask you something.
I never planned to ask you. But since we're here and we're being open and honest.
Are you cheating on Jasmine?
...
I think you already know the answer to that...
I don't know who I am anymore [mcf]. I don't act like me.
I have so much that I have to come clean for. I just don't know how to explain it.
You don't have to explain anything to me. It's Jasmine that you have to explain to.
You can't keep going on like this. You're hurting yourself and her at the same time.
You're right. I need to go [mcf].
I have to set some things straight.
Can Jasmine stay at your place for a bit? I'll call her when I'm ready.
You know she's always welcome to stay as long as she needs to... I've already told you that.
Okay... uhh...
Are we... good?
We're teammates Damien. I'm upset at what you did but I understand why. That doesn't mean I'm magically okay with it though.
I'll make things right [mcf]. Trust me.
We'll see Damien.
Oh man... what the fuck just happened?
I just came to make Kimmy happy... and now I have three more headaches to deal with.
Fuck it, let's go see what I came here to do.
Kimmy?
Huh, she must've went upstairs.
Kimmy??
She's not here either...
Oh. I think I know where she is.
It's not the biggest pool. But it's not bad.
You've got to be kidding me.
What? Don't like it?
I've always wanted a pool. The water keeps me calm.
Oh, so you do like it?
It's the best [mcf].
Good, what about the rest of the house?
It's amazing too. That green house was the nicest house I've ever lived in.
This one blows it out of the water.
I know that feeling.
So everything is good?
Yeah, I believe it is. I'm about to call my family. You can stay and meet them if you want to.
I would love to Kimmy... but I have to get back to my own family.We had some things planned today.
Okay... maybe some other time then.
Absolutely Kimmy. And don't forget to call if you need anything.
I will... and you do the same.
You can count on it.
I wish I was nicer to you from the start.
Eh, better late than never.
Thank you again... truly.
I hope your family is excited Kimmy. Let me know how it goes. I'll see you in class tomorrow.
Goodbye [mcf].
Okay... that's over...
I'm still so tired... I just want to go home and cuddle up with my girls and go to sleep.
But there's still so much to do... at least it will all be at my own place.
A few minutes later
Oh mom... what are you doing waiting by the door?
What do you think? I'm waiting on you.
Oh, that's sweet of you. I missed you too.
Is something wrong honey?
What? I'm doing okay.
What happened?
What? Do I have a cut on my face or something?
No, I'm your mother. I can tell when something is bothering you. What happened?
I just had to deal with something. I promise I'm fine.
Tell me already... Did you have another dream?
No, no. It wasn't anything like that.
What's going on? What's wrong [mcf]?
Nothing... [am] is getting worried about nothing.
Oh my god [mcf]... did you have another dream?
No... nothing like that at all. I promise.
You know Kimmy? The girl in our class? She needed a place for her and her family to stay.
I was going to let her stay at the last house we were at. Since we have no intentions to go back.
But when I got there I noticed that the door wasn't locked. When I went inside I found Damien and Ryker.
Why were they there [mcf]? And who is Ryker?
He's a jerk. But that's not the worst thing. It turns out that Ryker has been paying Damien to spy on me.
What do you mean spy on you?!
Exactly what you think. Turns out Ryker wanted to talk to me. He wants to try and transfer us all to a different college.
That's not even possible. He's trying to trick you [mcf].
Fuck him and Damien. Remember he told me he was going to be your bestfriend?
It's not that simple Shauna. Damien is only doing it so he can pay for his mom's medical bills.
Do you really believe that?
Yeah, I do. I don't think Damien would lie about that.
Are you going to tell Jasmine?
No, it's not my place. Damien said he was going to tell her everything.
Do I need to talk with someone at the school?
I'm afraid that wouldn't help mom.
What happened with the girl? Kimmy?
Ryker ended up leaving his key. She's staying there now.
Is she safe?
I think so... I told her to call me the second she felt she was in any danger.
Can we sit down to finish this? My legs are killing me.
Of course.
So... we're all safe?
Yes, I'll never let anyone touch a single one of you.
Is anyone trying to hurt us?
No mom, it's nothing like that. Ryker isn't trying to hurt anyone... he's just trying to help himself.
How can you be sure?
I wouldn't lie to you.
Hey... hey... it's okay. I know you're worried. It's a scary thing to hear.
But we have to trust [mcf]. I believe him when he says that he'll never let anyone hurt me.
I do too... I'm just worried for you girls.
I know... and I'm worried for you too. But all we're going to do is stress out [mcf] if we keep going.
Am I stressing you out honey? I didn't mean to...
It's okay mom... I know you're worried. But I'm telling you all that I know.
I'm going to get everything sorted out. So try not to worry about it.
I think I need to calm down... I'm going to go finish the laundry. I'm sorry [mcf].
You can stay mom. We can talk about it.
No... I trust you. And you need to rest. You've had a long day.
I did your laundry by the way... or at least I helped [am] do it.
Thank you Shauna.
No backtalk or protest saying I shouldn't have done that?
Nope not today... I'm just thankful for you.
I'm happy to help... I need to learn all these things anyway.
So now that it's just us two...
You sure there's nothing to worry about?
I mean... you girls should stay alert just in case. But no, I don't think anyone is in any danger.
Okay... that's all I needed to hear.
So how was your day?
It was another eventful one. Is Jasmine here?
Yeah, Jasmine, [g1], and Liz are all watching a movie.
So [g1] and Liz are getting along?
It certainly seems like it.
Well that's great. Why aren't you watching it with them?
It's a scary movie... I don't like them.
Heh, I forgot about that.
If you were here I might've watched it.
If I held you?
Mhmmmm...
Babe... you're home!
Hey [g1]. How's everything going?
Everything is fantastic. Everyone I love is here.
I'll wait until later to tell her about Ryker. I want her to enjoy her evening.
Is that a new outfit?
Uhh not exactly... It was in Rachael's room and I tried it on for fun...
I really like how my butt looks in it.
Well now you have to show me.
Damn, you weren't joking.
You really do have a great butt [g1].
I wish I had a butt like this.
Please... it's not like you don't have a great one too Shauna.
Yeah, I have to side with [g1] on this one.
It's a shame that we aren't all alone right now... so I could get better looks.
If Jasmine wasn't here I would take you up on that offer.
Yeah, it's too risky with her here. Liz too.
Elizabeth fell asleep already. She's not one to get scared and she fell asleep halfway through it.
She said she was tired... that she didn't sleep very well at Willow's.
Oh well then it's good she's resting some.
That's what I said.
Hey babe... guess what?
What's up?
We have our next surprise ready for you... we're saving it for in the morning.
Ha, that's not fair. You can't tease me like that.
Should we give him a hint?
Hmmm... sure...
It has to do with what we were talking about before.
And that's your only hint.
Oooh, that's exciting...
And hey there Jasmine.
Hey [mcf]. How did the rest of class go for you?
It wasn't bad. Me and Veronica went to the park.
Ha, I was wondering what you two would do.
Hey... I'm going to go help [am] finish the laundry.
*Whispering* And I'll help them out too. You should spend some time with Jasmine. She needs some attention.
Okay, I can do that. Bailey should be here soon also.
Well we'll be back there if you need us.
Love you girls.
We love you too.
So how's it going Jasmine?
Fuck... it's pretty awkward interacting with her after my talk with Damien... I wonder what's going to happen between the two of them.
It's pretty good. [g1] and Shauna are always a blast to hang out with... it's nice to just have some girl time.
Yeah... I bet so. Anything new with Damien?
Can we please not talk about him?
I came here to get away from that... let's talk about other things.
I'm sorry Jasmine. That was insensitive of me.
Woah Jasmine...
What's going on?
Why am I always asked about Damien?
Is that all anyone cares about? If I'm making him happy or not?
No, no, no. Jasmine. That's not at all what I was asking.
I asked about Damien because I know it matters to you. It has nothing to do with him.
It has everything to do with the fact that I want to see you happy.
But no more talking about Damien. I want to learn a few things about you Jasmine.
Promise? Nothing about Damien?
Yes, I promise.
Well what do you want to know about me?
Well I just realized something... turn your head to the side.
What is it?
Is there something on my face?
Is that a heart shaped birthmark on your cheek?
Heh, yes. It used to be by my ear but it keeps sliding down towards my lips.
I think that's adorable Jasmine.
Hehe, thank you. Not many people comment on it... especially guys.
But back to actual questions...
Hmmm... what are some of your goals?
Oh wow... not starting out easy huh?
Uhmmm... I sort've always imagined myself as Damien's manager. Or a sports writer.
Outside of jobs I want a family. I grew up with a strong sense of family values and I haven't even seen my family in a few years now.
It really makes me want to start my own.
I can understand that... I feel that way myself sometimes.
I never really knew my real family, except for my dad. Part of me wants to have a child just so I can give them everything that I never had.
That's really sweet.
I can see you and [g1] having really cute babies.
Shauna too. They're lucky girls.
All three of you being parents. They're both very lucky.
What makes you say that?
They know what they have. They know you're going to take care of them and the kid no matter what. To me that's invaluable.
Well thank you Jasmine. I think you'd be a good mom. You definitely have a nurturing presence.
I think so too... hey, is it cool if I take this shirt off? I have a top on underneath.
It's just a little hot in here.
You don't have to ask me that Jasmine. Go for it.
I just didn't want anything to be weird.
Ahh, I see what she was saying now. This would be a little weird if she didn't say anything.
Man, her body always shocks me a little bit. There's so many great asses in this office right now.
[mcf]?
[g1] is asking for you. Could you not hear her?
Huh?
Oh, I'm sorry. What is it [g1]?
I came to tell you that Bailey just called and said she was on her way.
Bailey's still coming? Awh, that's too bad.
Why is it a bad thing?
Because I was about to head home.
Come on Jasmine... you can stay for a little longer.
Hmmm... fine. But you have to join us.
Yep, come cuddle up with me babe.
I won't say no to that.
You two are so cute together.
You know me and [mcf] were just talking about babies. I was saying how you two would be excellent parents.
He didn't disagree with me.
I know he would be the perfect dad. It warms my heart just thinking about him pushing a child on a swing...
If that is us one day, I don't think I'd ever stop crying, just because of how happy I would be.
Bzzz, Bzzz
I'm sorry... I'm getting a phonecall.
*Whispering* Aah, I see why you didn't hear me at first now.
Yeah, my bad on that one.
Sorry again guys...
You're fine.
Hello? Who is this?
Oh... hey Damien. Why are you calling me from this number?
Oh shit...
What do you mean?
Are you drunk Damien?
What do you mean?! Why?
Damien I swear to god...
What happened Jasmine?
...
He told me not to come home!
Why?
I don't know!
Well fuck him... you can stay here.
What [g1] said. You're free to stay here with us.
It's okay Jasmine... look on the brightside. You don't have to put up with anymore of his antics. You can be your own person again.
...
We're here for you Jasmine... wether you need us to support you or to give you space. Just let us know.
Exactly what [mcf] said.
Fuck... I didn't expect that.
At least me and [g1] are here for her.
I'm fine...
Huh?
I knew it was going to happen sooner or later... I was prepared for it.
Are you sure I can stay here?
Absolutely Jasmine.
Can I go to sleep? I really just want to lay down.
Are you sure? Shouldn't we talk about this?
Yeah... we can lay down in a minute.
We just want to make sure that you're okay.
Can I please just go to sleep?
I really don't want to talk about this right now.
Jasmine...
It's okay baby... I'll take her back there to lay down.
*Whispering* I'll make sure she's okay... just spend some time with Bailey.
Are you sure?
Mhmm.
Thank you for letting me stay... I don't know what I'd do without you two.
You're absolutely always welcome here. If you need anything from me I'll be in here. Goodnight Jasmine.
Goodnight [mcf].
Fuck... why did Damien have to do it like that?
I thought he was actually going to own up to his mistakes...
I'm just glad me and [g1] were here for her... and that may be why Damien chose to do it like this.
Fuck... and now Bailey is about to be here... I can't tell her about what just went down.
Why? I'm at [mcf]'s house.
Oh... if you say so... I'll be there soon.
Everything okay Jasmine?
Yeah, Damien is being a little weird. He just called and said that I need to come home.
He probably just needs me to do something.
I'll see you two in class tomorrow.
Yep... we'll be there. Drive safe Jasmine.
Welp... that didn't last for very long.
Nope. But next up is Bailey.
Speaking of... I think I'll give you two some time alone. Me and her aren't that close yet and she's coming over to hang out with you.
You know you're free to hang out too [g1].
I know... I might pop in from time to time.
Plus there's a few chores I need to get done.
Mwah!
Just let me know if you need me.
I will baby.
Now just to wait on Bailey...
I do hope everything goes well with Damien and Jasmine...
I wonder how long I have before she shows...
Knock, knock, knock
The answer was not long at all.
Coming!
Hey [mcf].
Mmmmm... you're exactly what I need right now.
She really is... sweet and sexy to rid my mind of this strange night.
Oh yeah... why's that?
There's way too many reasons to count.
You're not wasting any time...
In a hurry are we?
I think you're somehow hornier than I am.
I think you're right...
Well let me show off some more then.
Mmmm... I love those shorts.
I'm sure you do... they basically show the top of my ass.
Are we alone?
There's girls in the other room. But they shouldn't bother us.
Good.
This is a nice place [mcf].
A lot of open space...
Tons of space to stretch out even.
I know exactly what she's trying to do... and it's working.
Oh! [mcf].
It's time to finish what we started in that kitchen Bailey.
There's that beautiful innie.
You have a perfect thigh gap too.
Ohhhhh....
Heh, you're soaking wet again Bailey... maybe you are hornier than me after all.
Mmmmm... deeper [mcf].
She's not pushing me out as much as she was last time. She's ready for this.
OHHHmmmm! Yes! Oh fuck!
Oh shit... I must've taken too long. She just pushed herself back into my thumb.
Keep... going [mcf]...
I want more... Please give me more.
Mmmm. I can give her more... but from a different angle.
Ohmmm... what are you doing?
You said you wanted more. There's better positions for this.
What were you thinking?
You said you like it a little rough right?
Mhmmm..
Let's get a little rough then.
[mcf]!
You're so fucking sexy Bailey.
Shouldn't we go somewhere more private?
Scared?
Liz is the only one that would be mad at me for doing this and she's asleep. [am]'s already walked in on me before.
[g1] knows we're in here too. She'll probably keep the others occupied.
No... I'm not scared.
Let's get started then.
You have a perfect pussy.
It's yours [mcf].
Mine? So I can do whatever I want to it?
Mhmm...
I know exactly what I want to do...
OHHH!! Fuck [mcf]!
How does it feel?
Mmmmm... I love it...
Do you want me to add another finger?
Mhmmm.
Say please.
Please [mcf]. I want you to stick another finger in me... pretty please. I'll do anything.
Ohhhhh.... Fuck.....
You're so tight Bailey.
I want to go deeper but I don't want to do too much too quickly.
Deeper! Oh fuck!!! OHHHMMMnnnnnnggghh!
Holy shit.
AHHNNGGGGHHooo!! Ooohhhhh.....
Did you just? Already?
Ohhhnnnnmmmm....
Holy shit... I'm sorry [mcf]. I didn't mean to.
Don't apologize. It was hot. You're good to keep going though right?
Of course.
Take your top off Bailey.
Mhmmm... yes sir.
I can't believe that's all it took to make me cum...
You said you've been thinking about this all day. You worked yourself up.
Or you just have magic hands... but I want more than hands.
You have such a nice body Bailey.
Please...
You're surrounded by boobs and butts twice the size of me.
I'm like the fun sized version chocolate bars compared to them.
Maybe I'm a fan of fun size. Show off for me a little Bailey.
Not much to show off... but here you go.
You say that like you don't have an amazing ass.
There's a lot I want to do to it right now.
Really now?
Then why am I showing off for you?
Because I wanted you to.
Oh... Well what do you want me to do now?
Call me Daddy.
Daddy? Hmmmm....
What do you want me to do now Daddy?
How rough do you want to get?
However rough you want to get.
Hmmm... Tell me to stop if I go too far.
I'll start off with a light squeeze.
AHhhh-
Do you like it?
Mmmmmhmmmmmm....
Good girl.
Ehh, let's keep it relatively light for now.
Oh... [mcf].
I love how firm your ass is.
I love how firm your entire body is.
Daddy... can I suck your cock?
[mcf]... can I suck your cock?
I want to make sure you're ready for what's next.
Oh, I'm ready... but yeah. I want you to.
Do you like me being on my knees for you?
I love it...
I want to feel your cock on my lips...
Just have to get these pants off...
Wow... you really are ready.
Told you so.
I swear it's even bigger than last time.
I'm happy I'm here.
I'm happy you're here too.
Do you say that to every girl that has your cock in their hand?
Hehe... I can't wait anymore.
Oh... Bailey...
That feels so good... have you been practicing?
..... Mhmmmm.
Heh, it fucking shows.
Keep going just like that Bailey.
Mmmmm...
Fuck Bailey...
She's letting me control her... she clearly can only go so far so I'm not pushing her past that.
That's something we can try after we've both had a few experiences together.
Mmmmm....
You're doing great Bailey.
As great as this is all I can think about is doing more.
Bailey... I'm ready for more.
I don't want to wait anymore. It's time.
Hehe, I thought you'd never ask Daddy.
Hehe, I thought you'd never ask [mcf].
How do you want to do this?
How experienced are you Bailey? I don't know how much you can handle.
I can handle anything... whatever you want to do.
We'll see about that. Here goes nothing.
Ahh! What are you doing?
Ha, It's pretty self explanatory.
Is this how you want to have sex?
As interesting as this position is... I just wanted to see how easy it is to throw you around.
What do you mean?
AHH! [mcf]!
Haha, it's as easy as I thought it would be!
Oh my god! You scared me [mcf]!
[mcf]?
Oh, I'm sorry... I meant Daddy.
You know I wouldn't hurt you Bailey.
I just wanted you in a better position for this.
Oh...
You sure you're ready? And you're sure you want this?
Absolutely.
Here we go Bailey. Let me know if I need to stop.
Okay...
Mmmmmm..... Mnnnn....
Hmmmm... Keep going...
AHHmmmmmnnnnggggg.....
Are you okay Bailey?
Mhmmmm....
It's a.... good pain...
I'll give her a second to get used to it...
Hnnggg...
You can start [mcf]... I'm fine... Hmmm....
I like the pain...
Ohhhhhh..... fuck....
You're so fucking tight Bailey.
I love your cock... Mmmnnnnn....
Stretch me out [mcf]...
Can I go faster Bailey?
Please fuck me harder Daddy!
Please fuck me harder [mcf]!
HOLY FUCK!!! HNNNGGG!!!
FUCK ME [mcf]! HMMMMGGG!
KEEP GOING! PLEASE DON'T STOP!
I'M GONNA....
Fuck Bailey! I'm close too!
AHHHNNNGGGG!!!
Holy fuck Bailey...
HHHnnnngghhhhmmm......
Hnnghh... fuck...
That was so fucking good.
I'm glad you thought so... because we're not done yet.
Oh!
I'm close Bailey.
Daddy... it's hard to stand...
[mcf]... it's hard to stand...
I'm sorry, I was just about to cum myself.
Fuck, I'm being a little too aggressive with her.
Oh... my bad. I spaced out when I got close and it's all I could think about.
Let's fix this.
If you need a second we can take a break.
Nuh uh... sit down.
I'm tingly but I can do this.
You're the best Bailey.
No, you are. This is incredible.
I hope we get to do this more... and try some more things.
All of this feels so right...
I've forgotten what life was like before you.
I'm really happy [mcf]...
I'm happy too Bailey.
Hehe... and you're not completely happy yet. Well... you're about to be.
Ohhhhh....
Damn Bailey... you're even tighter in this position.
Holy shit... it feels like your cock grew even bigger... Mmmmm....
Ahh! Fuck!
Jesus Christ Bailey...
Mmmmm... this position is even better...
I'll start riding in a second... Mmmm...
Your cock keeps growing... Hnnnnmmmmm...
I love how it feels gliding in and out of me...
I love how fucking tight you are...
Do you want to cum for me?
Keep going Bailey... I'm almost there.
Cum for me... Cum anywhere you want. Hmmmm....
Let your load go... give me all of it.... Hnnnggg...
If you don't soon then I'm going to finish again... Hnnnnnmmmm...
Fuck... I can't hold back [mcf]...
I'm so fucking close Bailey.
HNNNGGGGHHH!!!
MMMMNNNN......
I wonder how'd she would react if I...
HNNNNGGG....
Ahhhhh....
I'm cumming too Bailey!
HNNGG!
Fuck Bailey!
Oh my god!
You came inside me!
Fuck... yeah I did.
HNNGG!
Fuck Bailey!
Oh my god!
You came!
Fuck... yeah I did.
That was hot...
This was fucking great Bailey.
It really was... we'll be doing it again right?
Without a doubt. Let me hold you for a minute Bailey.
I'll be honest... I was pretty nervous about this.
But it was everything I was hoping it would be and more.
I'm happy you're happy Bailey...
I'm more than happy. You've turned my life on its head.
I'm excited for what happens with us... I'm excited to become friends with [g1] and Shauna.
I'm excited too. Today would be a good time to spend some time with them.
Yeah, you're right...
How about we get dressed and then I'll go talk to them?
Sounds good to me.
But first.
Mwah!
There... now it was the perfect date.
We still need to go on a proper date.
I'm very happy with how this one went.
Now let's get dressed.
A few moments later
Hmmm...
What is it?
I kind of miss being naked. I definitely miss you being naked.
Ha, yeah I know what you mean.
Will you be free any tomorrow?
I think I can make sure I have some time for you Bailey.
Hehe.
How are you two doing?
Hey Bailey. How's it going?
Not bad at all... just a bit of a busy day.
I'm excited to relax a little.
Well come on in.
Don't mind if I do.
Thanks for having me over by the way.
Of course Bailey. You're always welcome.
Not a bad place at all. Way better than our place.
I don't think we'll be here too much longer.
Oh... that's a bummer.
Where are the other girls at?
They're in the other room.
I was hoping to spend some time with them. I'd like to get to know them better.
Awh, I'm sure they'd like to get to know you too. Want me to get them?
No that's fine. I like spending time with you too.
How are you two doing?
I'm sorry for interrupting...
No baby, you're fine.
We're just finishing up all the laundry. Do you need anything [mcf]?
Have you ate today?
I'm okay babe... thanks for checking.
Hey [g1].
Hey Bailey. How are you?
I'm great... thanks for letting me come over.
You're free to come over any time you want to Bailey.
What about you? Is there anything you need?
Well... I'd actually like to talk to you some more [g1]. We should get to know each other better.
I'd be happy to. It's important for us to have a good relationship. Seeing as you cheer on [mcf] and everything.
Pssst.
[mcf]...
Oh, Liz wants me. I'll be right back ladies.
Hey, how's everything going?
Better... I'm still having issues but things are better.
Good... is everything okay?
Ehh, we need to talk about something [mcf].
I tried to bring it up earlier but [g1] made it hard.
What is it?
It's about my mom... She's probably going to come here.
Hey... it's okay.
Can we talk somewhere else?
Sure... we can talk over by the kitchen.
So... what's so bad about your mom?
[g1] kept you away from her for a reason... she's a lot.
She cares... a little too much.
Our dad used to cheat on her... she went crazy when she found out.
She's never gotten over it... and I told her about you and [g1]'s relationship...
That you've been with other girls...
Elizabeth... Why?
I'm sorry... I was angry and didn't know what else to do.
What did [g1] say about it?
She's just brushing it off.
Did you tell her about what happened between us?
No! I didn't tell her anything specific...
I'm so sorry [mcf]. I wish I could take it back!
I'm so sorry [mcf]. I wish I could take it back!
It's okay Liz. You're both adults now. There's only so much she can do.
I'll never do anything like this again.
I hope not... I just wish you talked to us Liz.
I know...
What are you two doing hiding in the corner?
...
I'm telling him about mom.
Why didn't you tell me babe?
I was going to handle it myself... I didn't want you to worry about it.
[g1]... don't worry about that. I want to know what's going on in your life.
I'm sorry...
It's okay... just no more hiding things because you're afraid I'll worry... okay?
I promise...
Have you talked to her?
No... I've been ignoring her. I don't care what she has to say. I'm happy.
You should talk to her... things will only escalate if you don't.
I can't...
Can I?
What do you mean?
I'll talk to her for you.
Are you sure?
Yes. I'll handle it. Just pretend she's not a problem.
No... we'll call her together.
I'm okay with that. When do you want to?
Tomorrow? I need some time to think about what I'll say.
Sure that works with me.
Can I be on that call too?
What would you say?
... I don't know.
I just want to be there for you two.
Oh... well then sure Liz.
I'm sorry again [g1]...
I know... I just wish we could've worked things out earlier... before this.
You have a fucked up sister... it's my fault...
But is it okay if I talk to [mcf] alone for a bit?
You don't have to ask me... that's up to [mcf].
Yeah, we can talk Liz.
I'll keep Bailey company while you two talk... we'll find another movie to watch.
Thanks baby.
I'm happy to help.
What do you want to talk about?
Can we sit back on the couch?
Sure.
So... what is it?
It's hard to talk about...
You know I'm not going to judge you Liz. We're family. You can tell me anything.
It's about us.
It's just... I've spent so much time thinking about us... if there's anything there.
It's killing me...
Liz... you're [g1]'s sister...
I know we've done things... but it's different now.
[g1] told me that if we were to ever be a thing that you would have to show that you're part of the family...
And you'd have to be okay with me dating other girls.
[mcf]... I've loved you for what feels like my entire life...
I don't care anymore. I just want you.
Liz... I care about you.
[mcf]. If [g1] was okay with it would you date me?
Yes Liz... despite everything we've been through and some of the headaches you've caused...
I love you. You've always been there for me, even if it's not how I would've liked.
I did it for attention [mcf]... your attention.
I know... but if [g1] was okay with it and you showed you're committed to making things work with [g1]. Then yeah... I could see us being together.
I won't let you down this time [mcf]...
Can I talk to [g1] now?
Sure Liz. Is that all you needed to talk about?
Mhmmm...
I'm not saying no forever... it's just that I haven't thought about you like that Liz... Not since [g1] told me you were off limits until you showed you were committed to making things work.
I can't say...
Liz...
I understand.
You're beautiful and I care about you. I'm not closing any doors. It's just not something I can really answer right now.
Can I talk to [g1] now?
Are you okay Liz?
Mhmmm... I just want to talk to [g1].
Okay Liz. I won't keep you.
Mhmmm... bye [mcf].
We'll talk about this again Liz...
Fuck...
I knew that talk was coming...
I need to talk to [g1] and see how she's feeling about that now... things may have changed.
Hmmm... what's left to do today?
There's the talk with Lauren... there was something else I was meant to do though.
What was it?
Oh fuck! I have to call Harp!
Ahh shit, I was meant to hang out with them and celebrate... I feel like an asshole.
I wonder if they still want to...
Ring... Ring...
There you are.
I'm so sorry Harp... some things happened and it slipped my mind that we were meant to hang out.
I assumed so... it's okay though. Natalie fell asleep as soon as she got home. She was tired.
So I'll let you slide this one time. But you're making it up tomorrow.
Absolutely... I'll be there.
Do you still want to go into practice early?
I'm down if you are.
See you there. Goodnight [mcf].
Goodnight Harp.
Phew, I'm lucky she wasn't upset. I fucked up.
I'll make it up to them tomorrow.
While I have my phone out I should check on Rachael... I haven't heard anything from her.
Ring... ring...
Hello? [mcf]?
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just calling to check on you.
Awh that's sweet. I'm doing good. I'll be home later tonight.
Feel free to use my bed. I won't be in it anytime soon.
I'm a little busy though... I'll see you soon okay?
Sure thing Rachael. Have a goodnight.
Goodnight kid.
Hmmm... I should call Lauren as well...
Ring... ring...
[mcf]?
Hey Lauren... are you still coming by tonight?
Uhh... I'm actually outside your place right now... I'm in a bit of a hurry. Can you let me in?
Oh. Yeah I'm on my way.
Knock, Knock
I'm coming!
Hi.
Hey Lauren.
You still wanting to have our little talk?
Yeah, I do. I think it could help me with a few things.
I'm sorry but I can't stay for super long. There's somewhere else I have to be soon.
Should we wait for another day?
No, no. We have enough time to get started with everything.
Okay, let's take a seat then.
Not a fan of her rushing this... but it's better than nothing.
I wonder where she needs to be... none of my business though.
So I'd like to start by getting to know you. I think I know most of what I need to know.
But let's start from scratch.
Well that's where I need the most help. My childhood has given me some issues recently.
Oh wow, let's start there then.
Sit down and tell me.
Do you know my past?
Slightly... I know that [am] isn't your real mother.
Did I hear my name?
Hey mom... you did. Meet Lauren.
It's nice to meet you [am].
I'm from WVM, I'm here to talk to [mcf]. Try to help him with some things... and he's helping me too.
Oh, it's nice to meet you.
If [mcf] is okay with it would you like to join us? We're going to go over his past. You might be able to give some valuable information.
Oh, sure. I can do that. If he wants me to.
What do you say?
Of course she can. I'd actually prefer if she did.
Perfect.
So... run me through your past...
Well... I don't remember much before my father passed away. I'll just tell you everything I know.
A few minutes of explaining later.
Wow...
You didn't need me... you remembered everything I did.
Still... I like having you here.
You didn't say very much about your biological mother. Why is that?
I don't know much... and I don't know how much of what I know is even real.
I've been having dreams about her. I've even been sleep walking in these dreams.
How vivid are the dreams? What happens in them?
They feel real... they play out like I've seen them before. As if they were just memories.
How often?
Every other day?
They scare me... I don't feel like I'm in control...
Have you tried to imagine her or any of the memories?
Not really... I try not to think about it...
You're in a safe place... can you try?
What do I need to do?
Just lay down and close your eyes... try to think of a memory of her.
Everything's okay honey... I'm here for you.
I love you mom.
I love you too.
What can remind me of her?
That lady I tackled... her smell was so familiar.
Her face... everything... focus...
Everything okay honey?
Mom?
Get up sweety. The floor is dirty.
[mcf]? What's happening?
I see her.
She was happy...
You excited?
We had plans... I don't remember for what.
Oh yeah... she used to hug me all the time... like every chance she had.
Always with this huge smile on her face.
She would hold me so tightly against her chest.
Her smell... I could make it out over anything... it's so distinct.
Brubru!
Huh?
I see my sister...
Oh!? What does she look like?
I've never seen her look like this before... She has dark hair now.
She called me brubru... I remember that name.
Have you been good for mom?
I think she's older than me...
Oh, she's a hugger too.
Sounds like a lovely home...
It wasn't... there was something else to this.
They hugged each other a lot too.
You didn't tell me anything about a sister.
I don't know if she's real... or if I'm just imagining her.
We're still going swimming right?
Oh yeah... my mom was so scared of swimming...
It took weeks to convince her to go.
I wasn't used to seeing her be scared.
She really didn't want to get into that pool.
But we made her.
Woo! Good job mom!
She didn't stay in for long... but her trying it for a minute was enough to get us off her back.
These all sound like lovely memories...
I hate to ask but can you think of any of the bad memories?
Hmmm...
I don't know.
Focus on negative emotion... think of pain.
Think of something you don't like... anything.
Oh...
What is it?
My sister is in a hospital bed. She's sleeping.
Oh wow.
My mom is here too.
Oh, that look. I remember it really well.
I hated it... I could tell she was in pain but she was hiding it from me.
She put on a smile but I could still see the pain in her eyes...
It's not the only time that's happened... I remember a time with [am] back when we lived in that mobile home...
It was late night, I woke up because I heard you.
I remember you sitting at that table... I remember saying your name.
I shocked you... but even still you looked at me with makeup running down your face from your tears... and you were smiling.
All you cared about was making sure I wasn't sad or worried...
You were crying because you didn't know how you were going to pay the bills that month.
I never knew how broke we were then until I was older. You never let me know... you hid me from that.
Your hard work and stress is why I am where I am now... but I hated that look.
I don't want others to protect me... I want to protect them.
Honey...
I love you so much.
I love you too mom... I owe you the world.
You don't owe me anything.
That's a very touching story but please focus [mcf]. I think we were close to something.
Right, sorry.
Negative emotions... fear...
There's something...
I see my sister... she seems scared.
Why?
I'm not sure... I think it may be because of my dad.
What is she doing?
She's looking at me... I can't hear her.
What's her name?
I don't know...
Think [mcf].
Hmmm...
She's smiling... she's doing the thing I don't like...
Why couldn't I protect her?
What's her name [mcf]?
Cedey... I called her Cedey.
Cedey?
Who is Cedey?
I don't know... that's all I can remember.
She called me Brubru and I called her Cedey.
Keep going [mcf].
Hmmm...
...
.....
I can't think of anything else Lauren...
Okay, okay. Sit up... Good job [mcf].
How was that?
You did great... that was all you. I just asked some basic questions.
I think I understand you more now.
Your past explains a good bit of why you're so protective of others...
I think you have a lot of flaws [mcf]. But they're not awful flaws... good things come from them.
Like what kind of flaws?
You're scared of people leaving you... more specifically you're afraid of being alone. You're over protective to the point it hurts you.
I'm assuming you have anxiety and you have a hard time telling people no.
[mcf]... are you really worried about people leaving you?
I mean... somewhat.
You know I never would.
I know mom... it's just one of those things that are hard to shake.
This was a really good start... I have to go talk to someone else now but...
Meet me in my office tomorrow? We'll discuss further.
Sure... I'll see you there. Thank you Lauren.
No, thank you. I'll see you later. Goodnight.
I wonder what she's in such a hurry about...
That went well...
So Cedey huh?
Yeah... it's something. I'm not sure exactly what but maybe it will get us somewhere.
I think it will.
*Yawn*.
*Yawn*.
Oh, you're making me yawn.
I'm sorry. I'm sleepy.
I am too mom... I think it's time to lay down.
Rachael said we could use her bed tonight.
Good, because some of the girls already are.
Ha, well let's join them.
You have to stop wearing heels. I'm meant to tower over you.
Ha, I like not breaking my neck to look at you.
I'm going to get changed into my pajamas and then I'll meet you in there.
Yeah... same here.
A few minutes later
Hey there [mcf].
Hey girls... you ready for bed?
Just waiting on you.
Where's Jasmine and Bailey?
Bailey is changing into some pajamas... she's staying tonight.
And Jasmine is in the bathroom over there.
Is she okay?
I think so... can you check on her?
Of course.
Jasmine?
Hmm?
Can I come in?
...
Hey... what do you need?
Are you okay Jasmine?
I'm great... Why wouldn't I be?
Can I come in?
Mhmmm...
What's going on Jasmine? Why are you in the bathroom?
I feel like an idiot... so much wasted time.
Was it really wasted time?
Weren't there good times?
I guess.
Then it wasn't wasted. Focus on those, remember them.
You had good memories, and you learned a lot from the bad ones.
You're a stronger person for going through them. And now you're a beautiful girl with a great personality with the rest of her life in front of her.
You really think so?
I know so.
What am I going to do now? I was living with him [mcf].
You're free to stay with us for as long as you need to.
I'd be asking for way too much [mcf].
Don't worry about that... we want you here Jasmine.
Thank you [mcf]. I don't know what I'd do without you.
I'm sure you'd be okay. You're strong Jasmine.
I'm going to pull my own weight... I'll keep things tidy and I'll help with whatever you need.
You're free to help in any way you want to... but focus on yourself for right now okay?
Deal... but I'll make it up to you.
I believe you Jasmine. Now let's go to sleep.
[mcf]... wait.
I mean it... everything you've done for me and will do for me will be paid back.
I trust that Jasmine... it's not needed though.
I know... but it's going to happen.
That's for later... now is for sleep.
Ha, lead the way.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's going to be.
Thank you for checking on her baby.
Where's Bailey?
Bailey is changing into some pajamas... she's staying tonight.
Oh, nice.
So, are we ready for bed?
Yep... Rachael said we can use her bed so let's pile up.
Can we all fit?
We can try.
Count us in.
Hey [mcf]... I'm sorry we didn't get to hang out more.
Yeah, so am I. There's always tomorrow though.
Exactly.
If you wake up Stacy then I'll wake up Elizabeth. Then we'll pile up from there.
Sure, let's do that.
Cedey? That's pretty close to Stacy...
Pssst Stacy....
Hmm?
We're going to join you... do you mind standing up for a moment?
Mhmmm...
Okay... who first?
Me!
And second?
I'll take that spot...
I call third!
Oh Shauna... with the news she shared today... that's a dangerous place for her to be.
Who wants next?
I'll go next.
Who wants to be on [g1]'s side?
I will.
Which one of you two left wants to go next?
I will.
That leaves you Jasmine.
Thank you guys.
Goodnight girls.
Goodnight. I love you.
Goodnight [mcf]. I love you too.
Goodnight honey. I love you also.
Goodnight.
Goodnight [mcf].
Goodnight everyone.
Goodnight [mcf].
Another day done... And there's no better way to end a day than laying in bed with 7 beautiful women...
Time to sleep.
That leaves you Stacy.
Mhmmm.
Goodnight girls.
Goodnight. I love you.
Goodnight [mcf]. I love you too.
Goodnight honey. I love you also.
Goodnight.
Goodnight [mcf].
Goodnight everyone.
Another day done... And there's no better way to end a day than laying in bed with 6 beautiful women...
Time to sleep.
Zzzzz....
Hmmm?
Oh... right...
We all went to sleep in Rachael's room.
[am] is here... where is everyone else?
Why didn't anyone wake us up?
Fuck. I hope I'm not late for my workout before practice.
Harper will kill me... especially after I forgot to call her yesterday.
Giggling noises
Hmmm... there's someone in the bathroom.
The giggle sounded a lot like [g1]. They did say they had a surprise planned...
Don't worry... he'll love it.
It feels strange Shauna...
Yeah I know... but it's for him. And we'll get used to it.
It doesn't hurt does it?
No, not really. It's just hard to get comfortable.
Uhh girls? Everything okay in there?
Oh! [mcf]! Come in!
Good morning handsome.
Good morning baby.
Good morning girls. Where is everyone else at?
They're all up and getting ready.
What time is it?
Early, you have plenty of time before you have to go to practice.
Good, so... what's going on in here?
We were working on your surprise.
Is the surprise my two girls bottomless? Because that's honestly not a bad surprise.
Hehe... no, not exactly. There's more than that.
Instead of telling him, let's show him.
Two amazing asses?
Look closer.
Oh... holy shit. When did you get a butt plug [g1]?
We bought them online and had them delivered yesterday. Do you like it?
Yeah, I do.
She's not the only one.
Damn girls... what made you want to get those?
A few reasons. They do more than just sit here too.
What do you mean?
So... what's going on in here?
We were working on your surprise.
Is the surprise my two girls bottomless? Because that's honestly not a bad surprise.
Hehe... no, not exactly. There's more than that.

Yeah, I do.
She's not the only one.
Damn girls... what made you want to get those?
A few reasons. They do more than just sit here too.
What do you mean?
Well first, we got them because...
We both want to please you in every way we can... And I want to work towards this.
I don't even know what to say... do you like it?
It's different... putting it in wasn't fun but it's fine now. Mine is smaller than Shauna's.
But that's not it... You can control them, they vibrate.
It's through an app. I didn't want to use your phone without your permission so I downloaded it on mine so you can try it out.
All you have to do is open the app and hit the button... You can set how strong the vibration is too.
Go easy on us please... for now.
Oh, she still has this picture as her background...
Heh, I forgot about that night. It was one of our first dates...
Ohhhh! [mcf]! Did you put it on high? That's too much for [g1].... Mmmmm...
Ahhhmmmm!.... [mcf]... that's a lot...
That was the lowest setting. I'll turn it off...
Lowest setting?! We're trying to have a little fun not cause earthquakes!
If that was low... high is going to be crazy.
Should we find out?
Haha! You better not!
You girls are giving me way too much control with this.
That's the point. You'll be able to turn them on whenever you want to... just don't go too crazy with it.
You can control each one seperately. Do you like your surprise?
It's great... we're going to have a lot of fun with these. Are they fine to take in a shower?
Yeah, they'll be fine. Are you wanting to take a shower right now?
Yeah I need one.
Sure baby, we all could use one.
A few minutes later
Are they washing me?
What are you girls doing?
Shhh... just relax.
We told you we were going to start helping in every way we can.
Don't you think this is a little much?
Do you like it?
I mean... yeah. I just don't want you girls to think that you have to do it.
We don't think that. We want to do it.
What she said. It's our way of giving back.
We're just trying to be the best girlfriends that we can be.
You're both doing an amazing job. I love you both.
We love you too.
A few minutes later
I wish we could have some fun this morning... I think the other girls are waiting to get into a bathroom though.
I know. We'll find some time today. Don't worry.
I can't wait, but speaking of time...
Me and Shauna were talking... what if we tried individual dates again today?
Last time we weren't as comfortable with everything as we are now.
If that's what you girls want. I'm fine with anything as long as I get to spend time with both of you.
I think it would be good for both of us... as much as me and Shauna love each other. We could use a little one on one with you.
Is that okay with you [mcf]?
Of course. Do you girls have any plans in mind?
I've been thinking... a dinner date sounds amazing.
Nothing special for me... I just want to cuddle alone with you and talk.
Done and done.
Thank you [mcf].
And... you're meant to workout before practice right?
Yeah.
Can me and [g1] come?
Sure. I'd love for you both to come.
That's great... we just want to keep you company.
Yeah... and we don't want to wait around all morning.
That's fine with me.
Now are you sure you want to have alone time? Last time you wanted [g1] there.
It's different now... I felt guilty not having [g1] there. I may still feel that way a little bit but I want to go on a date.
Sounds great to me. How fancy are you thinking?
Doesn't matter. Take me somewhere and get me some food and spend time with me. That's all I want.
We'll do something more than that. We'll figure out after class.
Okay.
Huh...
What is it [g1]?
Oh nothing... just your mom.
She looked so happy and peaceful when she was sleeping with you... now she looks sad.
Oh wow... she does.
You two are so cute...
She may need some alone time too.
Funny enough we have a date planned already today.
Three dates today? I'm sorry if we're asking too much. Our date can wait until tomorrow if it helps.
Not a chance. I'm looking forward to it.
Now you two finish getting ready. I'm going to go say good morning to everyone else.
Okay baby.
Phew... three dates. That on top of everything else that's planned... Today is going to be fun.
Three days now.
Oh cool.
Good morning Bailey... Stacy.
Oh hey [mcf]. How did you sleep?
I slept really well.
Uhh... can I ask you something?
Sure.
My mom wants to talk to you again... she was upset she had to leave last time.
Would that be okay with you?
Sure... when does she want to?
Sometime at night... that's the only time she can.
Yeah we can make that happen.
Thank you [mcf]... I'm going to go finish getting ready.
Why does she want to talk to me again?
Must just want to ask more questions...
Hey [mcf].
Hey, how did you sleep?
Uhh... not great.
Why? Too crowded?
No... not that. I just had something on my mind.
Oh, what is it?
I have to tell you something...
Now that we're a thing... I don't want to hide anything from you.
So you need to know this.
I'm listening Bailey. I don't want you to hide anything either.
It's about Rainn... Well, both of us.
Damn, a lot is being thrown at me early this morning.
What happened?
It was before I knew you.
I never really had a boyfriend growing up and last year I decided I wanted one.
I found a date but was really worried and Rainn agreed to go.
He was meant to bring a friend for her...
We were supposed to get ice cream. I got really dressed up and was really excited...
But they never showed.
I'm sorry that happened to you Bailey.
No, it's okay. It led to where I am now. But that's not the end of the story...
Rainn was there for me.
I won't lie... it hurt.
But she was there. We were living together at this point.
Not long after the date incident we were watching a show together.
It was one of those silly dating shows. I don't remember exactly how it happened.
I just remember her telling me she had feelings for me.
I didn't know what to do.
So we kissed...
Woah... did you two become a thing after that?
What? No... We kissed but that was it.
Were you not into her?
She's beautiful... but I couldn't be with her. And anyway... I have you now.
Why couldn't you be with her?
My family...
Bailey... you realize me and Shauna became a thing in a really similar way?
I really don't think about it but I'd imagine there's a lot of people that look at my relationships and think it's weird.
You can't care about what other people want. What makes you happy?
You do...
I'm not saying you have to do anything. I'm just saying that if you had feelings for Rainn then that's okay.
You're not trying to break up with me are you?
No, not at all. I mean it would be a little shitty of me to date other girls and tell you that you can't see where things go with your lifelong friend.
And I do mean while you're also dating me. You don't have to pick one.
Really? I don't know [mcf]...
Like I said it's whatever you want to do. I'm not trying to push you a certain way.
Mwah!
I'm so lucky to have you.
I could say the same.
Are you sure you'd be okay with it?
Absolutely...
I don't know still... I have to think about it.
I understand. It's not a simple choice.
Yeah... can we go back to normal now? Want to sit with me for a minute while I wait for a bathroom to open up?
Sure.
So that's why you didn't want me to come up to your room?
I didn't want to hurt her feelings...
I understand. You could've told me then.
I didn't want to freak you out.
It takes more than that to freak me out.
So we're okay?
We're perfect. And we'll continue to be considerate of Rainn. Maybe we can find her someone.
Mwah!
I'm so lucky to have you.
I could say the same.
Want to sit with me for a minute while I wait for a bathroom to open up?
Sure.
I slept pretty good.
Want to sit with me for a minute while I wait for a bathroom to open up?
Sure.
So... are you excited for your first game?
Yeah, I'm eager to see how we'll do. Once the games start they don't really stop.
I know things aren't perfect but they're a lot better than they were at the end of last year.
And with you... who knows what WVM can do?
Hopefully bring a few wins... at least.
Well I'll be cheering you on the entire year.
No one wants to cheer for a losing team though.
I think you'll win. I believe.
Bailey... a bathroom is open.
Good morning Liz.
Hey...
Oh [mcf]. Is it cool if we go with you to practice?
Yeah, I'm going in early though to workout some.
That's fine. Natalie said she would be there early anyway so we can keep her company until practice starts.
Thank you [mcf]. I'll be back soon.
Hmmm... that's everyone but Jasmine. I wonder how she's doing.
Part of me doesn't want to see Damien today. I don't know what I'll end up saying to him.
Oh, I bet Rachael is back. I need to tell her about what happened with Ryker.
Surely she has an idea of what I should do.
Not sure what else to do... I still haven't told [g1] about it.
Though I wouldn't doubt if Shauna told her.
Good morning [mcf].
Oh, good morning Jasmine. How are you doing?
All things considered I'm doing pretty good.
Thank you for letting me stay here...
Damn Jasmine... you're definitely not too shy about wearing small amounts of clothes.
Seen these before? Heh... [g1] let me borrow some clothes.
That's good. But I'll see about getting your clothes for you today.
That would be so helpful... thank you [mcf]... sorry if it's weird I'm talking to you in underwear...
I didn't really think about it...
I've technically seen you in less that day at the pool.
Ha, I guess these do cover more. Good point.
Is it strange that she's showing her butt to me? Or am I just making it out to be something it's not?
You're looking good this morning Jasmine.
Thank you. I'm wearing more makeup than usual... I just needed to feel pretty.
You don't need makeup to look pretty Jasmine. You're great as your natural self.
Awh... you're so sweet.
Hmmm... she's pulling me into her awfully tightly...
I don't think I'm going to class today...
I think that's a good decision. [am] and Rachael will keep you company.
[mcf]... you've been so kind to me ever since we met...
I remember one of the first things you said to me was that I was gorgeous... I've thought about that a lot.
You are Jasmine. On top of being gorgeous I think you're a great person overall.
That's why I hate that you're sad right now... I wish I could make it go away.
I'm not that sad... In some ways I'm happy.
Fuck... she's really pulling me into her now.
I like her a lot... but everything is so muddied right now. She could really use the attention.
At the same time she's fresh off everything with Damien. It would probably be best to wait.
I could say fuck it and go for a kiss... or play it safe.
Jasmine... I really like you.
Oh [mcf]... I like you too.
Mwah!
Oh my god... [mcf]... we just kissed.
Is that okay?
Mmmhmmm....
She's still hugging me... maybe even tighter now.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Jasmine where are you going?
I'll be back...
Jasmine if you weren't okay with that then I'm sorry... I might've misread things.
.....
No [mcf]... I'm happy about it. I didn't want you to see this big goofy smile...
I won't lie... it felt strange. Not because of you, just because of everything I'm going through.
I understand Jasmine. I don't mean to confuse things.
Don't worry about that... I think I need some alone time to think about things.
Sure Jasmine... whatever you need. I'll see you later today?
Mhmm...
Well... that happened. I had no intentions of going after her... not this soon anyway.
But that look she was giving me... I could tell what she wanted.
I wonder how Damien will take the news if he found out. Do I even care?
He had his chances, if he wanted her then it's his own fault.
I still need to find Rachael.
No... it's too soon for that.
I'm happy you're happy. So you're going to spend the day with [am] right?
Mhmm... I'll probably keep to myself for the most part though.
[am] will help you through whatever you need.
Like mother like son?
Exactly... and call if you need anything.
I will... I'll let you get back to getting ready. I'll see you later okay?
Yep, you sure will.
I think she wanted more from that... I may just be thinking crazy though.
I still need to find Rachael.
Just spend time with them. [am] will help you through whatever you need.
Like mother like son?
Exactly... and call if you need anything.
I will... I'll let you get back to getting ready. I'll see you later okay?
Yep, you sure will.
I think she wanted more from that... I may just be thinking crazy though.
I still need to find Rachael.
What to do next?
Oh, I bet Rachael is back. I need to tell her about what happened with Ryker.
Surely she has an idea of what I should do.
Not sure what else to do... I still haven't told [g1] about it.
Though I wouldn't doubt if Shauna told her.
Let's see if I can't find her now.
Oh, she's right there. That's convenient.
Good morning Rachael.
Hey kid. Miss me?
Yeah I did. We need to talk about something.
Yes we do.
You never even asked me where I went.
I don't like to meddle... at least not too much. But where did you go?
You remember that girl I showed you yesterday?
The one I got scolded for looking at?
I have my reasons... I went to pick her up. So she's here today.
When am I supposed to meet her? And where?
We'll talk about that later. I'm not sure yet.
I didn't realize how much I'd miss being around you all.
It's good to be back.
Will you have to leave anymore anytime soon?
Hard to say... I don't think I will though.
My flight was awful... a baby was screaming the entire time and the lady next to me spilt her drink all over my shirt.
I don't see any stain?
That's because I changed... do you take me to be a filthy woman?
Or did you just want a free chance to look at my cleavage?
And if you dare say both then I'm kicking you out.
Haha, I thought about it.
Yeah I could tell. Oh...
I have a surprise for you.
Is it cleavage related?
Afraid not... follow me.
I honestly did miss Rachael... she's witty.
Doesn't hurt to have someone with all her connections around either.
A brand new car!
Oh wow Rachael... it's nice.
It's not bad. It'll get us where we need to go.
I'm giving you the second set of keys... if you wreck it you pay for it.
And you can drive it whenever. I'll only need it sparingly.
Thank you Rachael.
So you park that supercar for good.
Yeah... about that whole thing. We need to talk.
Want to sit in the car first?
Sure.
Comfy in here right?
Yeah... way more room than the other one.
So what's up?
*You explain everything that happened with Kimmy, Damien, and Ryker.*
You left Kimmy there?
Yeah, she had her family. I told her if she suspected anything at all to call me.
And he said he could get you transferred?
Pretty much...
All to stage a bet?
That's what he said.
I'm not buying it... why would he tell you all of that?
To scare me?
I mean yeah... but he could've done a lot more. There's more to this.
I think he's setting you up... he wants you to tell on him.
He hit all the points... breaking rules, to puppeteering his uncle. He gave you all the info that you'd have a hard time proving.
But why?
I'm not sure... all that I am sure of is that he wouldn't tell you all of that if that was really his plan.
What should I do?
Can you get any more information?
I'm meant to hang out with Charles and Damien tonight. I'm sure I could ask about it.
I really don't want to go though.
Yeah... sounds sketchy. But you could learn a lot. I think you should go.
I'll be outside in this car... parked a little bit aways. Just so you have a quick out in case things get weird.
Okay... I'm just worried about something happening to one of the girls.
If he tries anything then he's a dead man walking. I promise.
I'm glad you're here with us Rachael.
Well that's sweet of you. This past week has been a lot funner than the ones before it.
Speaking of funner...
I've always wanted to fuck in a car... but never have.
Do you want to change that?
Damn, she didn't hesitate with that at all.
Rach... out here in the open?
We're in an alley... come on. I'm horny.
Really? You've never had car sex?
Huh, I haven't either.
Nope... but there's plenty of room in the backseat.
Fuck Rach... those tits will always shock me.
They're pretty great...
Hmmm... okay. Fuck it. Let's do it.
Really?
Yeah, I could use this.
Fuck yes...
You have fantastic tits Rachael.
They're pretty great...
This isn't a good idea Rachael...
Why not?
Uhh... I just don't have the time this morning. I'm meant to meet my coach for a workout.
Fuck...
Guess it's a morning with my hand then...
No harsh feelings?
No, we're good.
So... backseat?
Backseat. You climb over first and take your clothes off.
Oh... I'm excited. I've thought about doing this since I started driving.
What stopped you?
Sometimes things just don't happen how you want them to...
Until they do.
Well let's make that dream come true.
You have such a nice cock [mcf]...
And you're already hard for me...
I think you could be harder though.
This isn't a very busy alley is it?
No... not this time of day anyway. We're fine.
I'm just going to make sure you're good and ready for me.
You ever have your dick sucked in the back of a vehicle?
No I haven't...
Oooohhhh.... Can I?
Mhmm.
Mmmmm...
Grrgg... So big...
I was already ready for this... especially after my shower with Shauna and [g1].
But I'm not complaining...
Mmmmm...
I'm fucking soaking wet [mcf].
Fuck me... please. How do you want me?
This is your dream scenario. How do you want to be fucked?
Ooohhh... I have an idea...
Fuck me like this. We don't have too much room.
Stick your cock in me and fuck me [mcf].
I need it...
Fuck... I think I do too.
AHH!! Fuck! Your dick is so fucking thick!
Don't stop! Just fuck me [mcf]... Fuck me senseless!
Not the best position but I'll do what I can.
Fuck! [mcf]! Glide that cock in and out of me!
I need more!
You have to go faster! Please! Fuck me!
She asked for it...
FUCK!!! HNNNNNGGGG!!!
JUST LIKE THAT! FUCK ME! KEEP GOING!!!
Fuck me she's being loud... but this does feel fucking great.
GIVE IT ALL TO ME! MAKE ME YOUR BITCH!
FUCK!!!
We're shaking this vehicle... Next thing you know we're going to fog all the windows
FUCK! Hhmmmmmmnnnn.....
Do you like it? Do you like my tight pussy?
I fucking love it.
OHNNNmmmmm... KEEP GOING!! Fuck!
Right there... right there!!! RIGHT THERE!!!
FUCK!!!
OOOOHHHNNNNGGGGGHHH!!! FUCK!!!
I'M CUMMING! I CAN FEEL YOUR COCK THROBBING! CUM WITH ME!
FUCK!!!
HHHNnnnggg!!
Oh fuck! You did it! You fucking came with me... holy shit...
My body is shaking...
HHHNnnnggg!!
Oh fuck! You did it! You fucking came with me... holy shit...
My body is shaking...
Was it what you wished it would be?
Hold on... let my body catch up to my brain...
Haha. I'll take that as a yes then.
Fuck yes! That was good... really fucking good.
You're impressing me kid.
Mwah!
Phew... we should probably get dressed.
Yeah... I need to be getting to the college also.
Well this was fun... won't be the last time we fool around either.
Definitely not...
A few minutes later.
Wow... that really drained me. I think I'm just going to go lay in bed for a while.
We kept it warm for you.
Oh, I saw.
What a great start to a day...
I have to agree with you there.
So... We'll talk later?
Yep... I'll be back here after class.
I'll be here... though you may have to wake me up.
Am I allowed to do that?
Today, yes. Usually, no.
Ha, fair enough. Do you mind telling the other girls to head out when they're ready?
Sure.
See ya kid.
Bye Rachael.
Oh, before I go. I have a surprise planned for you.
What kind of surprise?
A good one... I'll tell you more when we talk later. Bye kid.
Bye Rach.
I may be a bit late to meeting Harper...
Depends on how long it takes the girls to come out.
It was cool of Rachael to get another form of transportation... though I wish I had my own car.
Baby?
Are you ready to go?
Yep, what do you think about the car?
Rachael already showed me... but it's nice.
Oh. Want to drive it?
Rachael said only you can. We're not allowed to.
Which is fine with me.
I like the interior.
Yeah, I do too.
I like the exterior too.
It's not bad... Oh...
You think you're funny huh?
Says the girl with a huge smile on her face.
Plus after the shower... I'm excited for later.
I am too... I want to experience everything one on one again...
After we cuddle right?
Hehe, yep.
We good to go?
Liz and Bailey are riding too. They asked me this morning.
Oh, cool.
You already seen the car too?
Yeah... she showed all of us already.
Ahh, it's what I get for sleeping in.
You girls sure you're okay keeping me company? You don't have to.
Mwah!
I'm willing to go anywhere with you two... Especially when I get to watch you workout.
What she said.
You girls are awesome. Let's get ready to go.
Yeah, we should. Me and Shauna will ride in the back.
Do you girls still have those plugs in?
Mhmm.
Yep. Just for you... but be gentle today.
I will.
Mwah!
Ooohhh... it smells funny in here.
New car smell?
Something like that.
Ooohhh... it feels weird to crawl with this in.
Yeah... I bet.
Ahh, back to normal vehicles.
Never been a fan of wood trim... but it could be worse.
And there's the other girls... huh, those look like new outfits.
They are. Liz was talking about them last night.
I like them.
Mind if I ride shotgun?
Go for it.
A few minutes later
I swear this place smells different every single day.
Haha... true.
Natalie said she was in the cheer room. So that's where we'll be.
Sounds good. If you need anything you know where to find me.
Bye [mcf].
Bye...
See ya girls.
You two sticking with me right?
Mhmmm...
Going to workout any?
Maybeee... I don't know yet.
Do you girls know where the actual gym is?
I know around where it should be but not exactly.
Follow me then.
Ehh, actually made it on time. Nat is here too so that means Harper is.
So the gym should be open.
A little bit later
Yep, it was open. Harp isn't here yet though.
She must be busy with something else.
Wow, it is a lot like our old gym [mcf].
Told you so. The layout is very similar.
Are those treadmills back there?
Yep, sure are.
Great!
Heh... last time we were in a gym together we still hadn't slept together.
We've changed a lot since then.
Yes we have. It's been a crazy week. But I'm happy we are where we are now.
You have no idea... I was a girl who was afraid of everything. I'm a lot more confident now.
I'm glad... and I can tell.
I don't even recognize that girl anymore.
Ha, I still do. I'll never forget her.
Hehe... where did Shauna go?
She went running towards the treadmills.
What's up Shauna?
I was going to run on this... but I don't know how to work it.
I'll show you. But you should really change out of your school uniform first.
Into what?
There's outfits here still. They stocked up everywhere.
I'll grab us a few.
Thank you [g1].
Where can I change?
Here, no one will bug us. Not this early.
What about your coach?
She won't care. Plus it's a quick change...
Okay...
Here goes nothing...
The fact she's even doing this shows she's more confident too.
Jesus Shauna... you look fucking stunning.
Is that what all of you girls wear under your uniforms?
Huh? Yeah pretty much. Do you like it?
I fucking love it. You look so fucking sexy in it.
It's just some underwear [mcf].
Yeah but its your amazing body in the underwear that's getting to me.
Wow [mcf]... you really do like them.
Yeah I really do. I wouldn't mind if you just wore that around.
I bet you wouldn't.
Yeah... I see it now.
Look at your other girl.
Jesus Christ... you girls are too much for me.
What is it babe?
You two are too fucking sexy.
Let us see the other side [g1].
Fuck me...
I wish we weren't in this gym right now.
It's too risky to try anything since Harp might show at any minute.
[mcf] was telling me how much he liked our underwear.
Yeah I can see that. I think it's the leggings.
They definitely don't hurt.
And you two still have your plugs in under that?
This is too much for me.
Haha, we should get dressed before [mcf] tries something.
I don't think I'll be able to tell him no.
Haha, me neither. Let's get dressed.
Awh man... smart call though.
A few minutes later
How are these?
You girls will look sexy in anything. Though I liked the underwear more.
You'll see us in it again... sooner rather than later.
I hope so... You girls want to start with a run?
Sure... it might be hard with our accessory... but I'll try.
Yeah same.
One cardio workout later.
I want to jump straight into benching... but it's been a bit.
I should start with dumbbells.
A few minutes later
Okay... I'm ready.
I don't have a spotter so I should start lower. For now at least.
It's good I didn't wait too long to do this... I can tell I'm already falling out of my usual condition.
I have to work on that.
Huh? Girls? You finished on the treadmills?
Mhmmm. All done.
Hey [mcf].
What's up?
Can I suck your cock?
What? We can't. Harper will be here any minute.
Nuh uh, she just told me and [g1] that she would be a little bit longer.
You were too busy lifting that bar to notice.
So can I?
It was torture sleeping on your groin last night... all I could think about was pulling your sweatpants down.
But someone would've noticed. I did play with it a little bit...
What do you mean?
I nudged it until you were hard... I rubbed it really slowly... then slept on it.
So please?
I'll be quick. I'll do my best. I promise.
If Harp really said that... then sure Shauna.
Yay! Thank you!
Oh Shauna...
She's lightly biting my dick through my shorts.
Don't tease me Shauna... We'll need to be quick.
What about you [g1]?
Hmm?
Oh, she's into this too.
Babe?
Oh, yes baby?
Do you want to join in?
No... Shauna wanted to do this, I just want to watch.
Well actually...
I want to hold you while she does it...
Heh, if that's what you want...
That's cute of her. She's holding on tight.
I wonder why she only wants Shauna to do anything...
I'm assuming she just doesn't want to do anything in a gym.
Shauna is going at it... you can tell she was waiting for this.
[mcf]... take off your shorts. I don't think she's going to come up for air.
Hah, yeah we don't have time for much teasing Shauna.
I love you [mcf].
I love you too Shauna.
Hehe... so we need to be quick? Should I take off my shirt?
If you want to, yeah.
Bye bye shirt!
What happened to my shy Shauna?
She's still here... I just really want this.
I think you do too...
I absolutely do.
Do you want me to start now?
Mhmmm... be a good girl and start.
Mmmm... fuck Shauna. You're not holding back.
I love how into it she is. She's instantly sucking and flicking her tongue.
There's no other feeling like it.
MMNNNNgg....
Woah. Just like that Shauna, you made him flex.
Fucking hell...
Is she that good baby?
Yes she is.
I can't forget about [g1]... I want her to feel involved even if she sat this one out.
A few grabs where I can should keep her in this.
Ohhh...
OHHH!
Mmmmm...
Fuck me... she's way too good at this. She's not even using her hands anymore.
Oh fuck Shauna...
The way she just goes for it.... fuck...
How does that feel baby?
Like it's exactly what I needed.
She's just getting started.
Mmmm... you think so?
HMMMNNNN.... Jesus...
Hehe, I can feel you tighten up everytime she goes down.
You really like this huh?
Yeah, I really do.
Mmmmm...
I wish I was as good as her at this.
You're great too baby.
HNNNGGMM...
Holy shit I just about came when she did that... I'm so deep in her throat...
Hehe, it's getting hard to hold you back.
Fuck Shauna... keep going just like that.
You're so fucking amazing...
I'm gonna...
AAHHHNNNGGGhhhhh!!!! Fuck!
Oh my god [mcf]! It felt like your entire body just finished... you got so tense.
Phew... fuck...
HMmmnn.... Huh. Shauna isn't moving anymore, she's just holding it...
Shauna?
Mmmmm...
Let her enjoy it baby, she earned it.
Ahhh....
Oh, Shauna. You still have it all in your mouth. Are you going to swallow it?
Nuh uh...
Oh, what are you going to do?
Mmm...
You came a lot [mcf].
Yeah, it definitely felt like I did. That was amazing Shauna.
Hehe... thank you.
So what are you going to do with that?
I'm going to share, [g1] said she hasn't gotten to taste you in a while.
Shauna! I told you...
I know, I know.
You have plans to fix that... but why wait?
You were talking about it too... and you did all the work.
I got plently... He came in my throat [g1].
That's what you wanted right?
Mhmmm.
Can I baby?
That's up to you [g1]. But I don't mind at all. Why would I?
Come on [g1], it tastes really good.
There we go!
See? Tastes really good doesn't it?
Mhmmm...
Mmmmmm...
Damn [g1]. You're not leaving a drop.
Yeah this is definitely different than the last time I was in a gym with her.
You wanted this more than you let on.
Want to see if there's any more in him?
Haha, I'm afraid I'm out for the moment.
You do taste really good baby.
I'm glad you girls think so... I still don't believe it.
I'm shocked by [g1]... I didn't think she'd do it.
I'm not, you're both my good girls.
Hehe...
...
Huh, either I'm looking for something that isn't there or [g1]'s attitude changed...
Maybe she wasn't as into that as we thought.
Let me get dressed and I'll see if anything is bothering her...
Oh!
Shauna? We need to get dressed.
We're pushing our luck.
Mmmm...
You had a little left on the tip.
Couldn't let it go to waste.
Hehe, I think you're good now.
Yeah I think so too. Now come here.
Hey... thank you for letting me do this here. I know I'm being silly but I didn't want to wait until later.
Does this mean you don't want to have any fun after our date today?
No, it means you'll get more than my mouth next time.
Oooh... well it can't come quick enough then.
Hehe.
Yeah [g1] seems out of it. Like she's thinking about something else.
I have a few ideas of what it could be... she just needs to get her mind off of it for a minute.
And I know how to accomplish that.
What are you doing babe?!
AHH!!
Babe!!! You scared me!
Haha, well you shouldn't be such a scaredy cat then.
I'll remember that. I'm going to get you back.
I'd like to see you try.
Heh, you'll see.
I'm sure... so babe. What's on your mind?
What do you mean?
I can tell you're thinking about something.
Oh [mcf], it's nothing. I was just thinking about how different I am now...
I just licked your cum off of Shauna's hand... think about that but put us back into a week ago. It would never happen.
No it wouldn't. But you're happy we are where we are now right?
One hundred percent baby... I'm the happiest I've ever been.
I am too... so why is it on your mind?
It's my mom... I just thought about how much she would hate this all.
Yeah, that's what I thought it was.
Me and you are still going to talk to her. Everything will be okay.
She may not understand but I think she'll accept it when she sees how happy you are. I'll make sure of it.
Really babe?
I promise.
Mwah!
I love you so much.
I love you too. We'll talk more about how we'll handle it later okay?
Mhmm...
It seems really important to [g1] to keep a healthy relationship with her mom... I have to remember that.
Hey babe... you should really get dressed.
Last thing you need is for Harper to walk in on us like this.
Ha, you're not wrong.
A few minutes later.
And the water was cold!
That's not good... the water pressure there isn't great.
Oh [mcf]! Finally.
Good morning Harp.
You too... phew...
Tough morning?
Yeah, you can say that.
Charles is making me run around. A lot of people didn't show up today.
Really? That sucks.
Yep...
I actually have to leave again. I have to bring him some papers from my desk. Then who knows what else.
I just want to sit down for a minute... it's been nonstop since I got here.
I'll take them for you.
No... you need to workout.
Really Harp. I have to talk to Charles anyway.
Are you sure? I'll love you for life if you do this for me.
Ha, yeah I'm sure. I don't mind at all. Where are the papers?
They're in the other room, the one we met in.
You're the best... and watch out. Charles is cranky.
Though he likes you, so you'll be fine.
I'll handle it. I'll be right back.
Thank you again. When you come back we may be on the actual court. We're going to run through some plays today.
Sounds good to me.
I'll be back in a moment girls... I have to run some papers to Charles.
Do you want us to come with you?
No it's fine. I'll only be a moment.
Want us to stay in here or follow Harper?
Follow Harp. I'll be back.
We'll be waiting.
Call if you need anything.
Part of me hopes Charles is too busy to hang out tonight...
I don't feel that that's likely though.
Hey [mcf]... wait a second.
Why do you have to talk to Charles? Is everything okay?
Yeah, I just made a dumb promise to hang out with him and that's tonight. So I need to see if that's still on.
You poor thing.
Ha... I'll be alright.
A few moments later
I wonder who all didn't show today? Lauren?
I'm sure Charles will tell me.
Oh, Willow is here.
That's two mornings she's here early... I wonder if she's meant to talk to Lauren again.
Hey Willow.
...
Willow?
Are you asleep?
Should I wake her? What if she needs to be somewhere?
Doesn't hurt to ask?
Hey Willow...
Wake up...
Huh?
AHHH!!!
Willow, It's me.
Ahh!!
Oh fuck I freaked her out. She kicked herself off the wall.
I've been in this situation before.
I got you!
Ahhhh!!!
Fuck!
You're okay. I got you.
I didn't mean to scare you... I'm going to sit you down.
Are you okay?
...
I'm fine.
I was just trying to check on you... 
Uh huh.
What happened?
Oh, hey. Nothing happened, everything's okay.
Why is she on the floor?
I scared her on accident.
Were you asleep in the hallway again Willow?
Leave me alone Mackenzie.
You can't keep doing this Willow.
...
Whatever.
Where are you going?
...
Willow?
...
She's not going to stop.
I should make sure she's okay... I scared her pretty badly.
So? She shouldn't be sleeping in the halls.
Plus the only thing that way is the teacher lounge and the gym. You're never going to find Willow in a gym so your best bet is the lounge.
Yeah, good point.
What are you doing in the halls anyway?
I could ask you the same thing?
What's that supposed to mean?
That we're both in the hallway doing our own thing.
Listen here... You won't disrespect me like that. I've helped you out way too much for that.
Woah, woah. I didn't mean it like that.
I busted my ass off just to get your name out there!
Mackenzie, I didn't mean to offend. I was just being playful.
I'm bringing some papers to Charles for Harper, that's why I'm here.
Oh, shit...
And thank you for... getting my name out there.
It's what I do. Have you been keeping track of your social media?
Uhh... not really. I've never really been into it.
...
Fuck...
But I'm going to start getting into it. Can't let all your hard work go unnoticed.
Hmm...
Do you really not look at your social media? Don't you care what people are saying?
Not really... it's not like they're going to make me a better player.
So what? You just make posts for me? About what?
I'll show you. Mainly just WVM hype stuff. That's not really what people talk about though.
What do you mean?
You grew fast... really fast. Which made sense at first considering star player in the news and all...
But then I looked at how you were growing. Who do you think are looking at your profile?
Sports fans?
Hah, nope. They're there but it's mainly women age 20-40.
What, why?
They're super into your relationship. It's crazy to me.
But it made my job easy. Which I've been meaning to ask...
How do you want your social media to be? Basic and professional, playful and sarcastic, or feed into the relationship stuff?
Can you explain further?
Basic is well... basic. Pretty much what it is now, boring posts about how you're happy to be here and all that.
Playful would be joking around with other celebrities and brands. Maybe make fun of a hater or two. That sort of thing.
And we could share images of you and your girlfriends to feed the relationship crowd...
This will mainly effect how media will talk to you. Though the relationship one could net you a lot of fangirls.
Have a preference?
Keep it basic... no need to do anything major with it.
Hey that keeps my job easy.
I'll let you deliver those papers... I'll see you around. Check your profile later.
Oh okay. Bye Mackenzie.
Playful sounds okay... I don't want to be too boring.
Hmmm... this will be fun for me.
Is there anything I need to do?
No, I'll handle it all.
I'll let you deliver those papers... I'll see you around. Check your profile later.
Oh okay. Bye Mackenzie.
Fangirls don't sound too bad. Are they a loyal fanbase at least?
Ehh... just don't fuck up. They'll turn on you quick.
So to make this work I'll need pictures with [g1], Shauna, and you.
I'll send you some.
Perfect, this should also increase the amount of girls that show up to your games. Especially if the other two will be there.
They will.
Good, good.
I'll let you deliver those papers... I'll see you around. Check your profile later.
Oh okay. Bye Mackenzie.
So her name Mackenzie... I better not confuse that with Mackey... she has a temper.
I need to remember to check my profile later... I wonder what she has in mind.
Oh well... enough of that for now. I need to check on Willow.
She has to be in here... or she's in the gym with the other girls.
But that's unlikely. So I'll check here first.
I think I hear someone talking in there.
Dev note :)
Emiko had a redesign. All of her previous renders will be remade to her new model in time for the week 1 release. :)
Thank you to everyone in my discord who helped me design her!
It'll be okay Willow...
Emiko??
She's the last one I expected to see in here.
Eek! [mcf]!
I was only in here for a moment! I was just about to leave!
I don't care that you were in here. I'm not going to tell anyone...
Ohhh... what happened to Willow?
I scared her on accident.
Oh... do you need me to stay? I need to get back to practice but I can help if you need me.
No you're fine Emiko. I got this.
Phew... good.
What were you doing in here anyway?
I really like coffee... and Lauren makes incredible coffee.
So I was sneaking in here to get a cup.
Didn't take you to be the kind to sneak into the teacher's lounge.
Love can make people do crazy things.
And you love the coffee?
Mhmmm. I'll see you at practice okay? Thanks for not telling on me.
No problem. See you Emiko.
Oh shit I just noticed she's wearing a different uniform than Bailey and Elizabeth.
That one is a lot more revealing... Emiko has nice legs.
Okay... focus. Willow doesn't like me trying to force my way into her problems...
So instead of trying to do that I'll just make sure she knows I'm here to talk to if she does need it.
Willow... I don't know what's going on in your life. I don't need to.
But I just want you to know you're not alone. If you need anything I'll help in anyway I can.
Ugh....
What is it Willow?
...
You can't help...
I wish you could but you can't...
I'm talking to Lauren... I'm doing everything I can already. You're just stressing me out.
I don't mean to.
Life has gotten weird recently and I can't control it. That's all.
Are you in any danger?
No... I'm not in any danger.
But I do miss Liz. I slept better when she was there
You know you can come over whenever now. We can keep you company.
I don't think they really want me there...
They would tell me if they didn't. Like I said I have no clue what you're going through but you could use some friends to help you get through it.
Can you promise me something?
Awh, she has faint tears in her eyes...
If they ever say they don't want me there... or there's any complaint at all. You'll let me know?
I promise.
Okay... can I ask one more thing?
Could you give me a ride home after your practice?
After practice? What about class?
Did you not hear? Veronica was a no show today. Told Charles she wouldn't be here.
Oh, fuck.
So yeah, I don't have a ride home.
I got you covered Willow. We'll drop all the girls off and then I'll drive you home.
I can give you gas money.
Don't worry about it. It's a friend helping a friend.
Thank you...
Don't mention it.
Oh, that's a tight hug...
Are you going to come over today?
Uhhhh....
Fuck... you can tell she's in a lot of pain.
But all I can do is be here for her.
Is Elizabeth busy today?
No, she should be free.
Then maybe. I don't know yet.
Listen [mcf]... you're being really nice so I don't want to be rude...
Can you leave? I need to be alone right now.
Sure Willow. I'll see you after practice. And if you need me then that's where I'll be.
Okay...
That sucks... but at least there was some progress made.
Sucks about class too... I hope Veronica is okay.
Oh, Emiko. What are you doing here still?
I had to tie my shoe. And since I was already down here I figured I'd wait on you to come out.
Oh, that's nice. You don't need to be at practice yet?
The girls are still trying on some of the new outfits.
Yeah I noticed those.
Oh! How is Willow?
She's better... I have to say though I didn't expect to see you talking to her. After what happened and all.
That's part of the past. You can barely tell I got hit now and even more importantly... She apologized.
She said sorry to you?
No but I didn't do it for me... I did it for [g1]. And I heard Willow apologized to her.
It was about doing what was right. And Willow did what was right.
That's a very mature mindset Emiko. I can't say I would think the same. You're awesome.
Hehe... thanks.
High five!
Haha... okay.
I'm still meant to be the one protecting you.
You'll have your chance eventually I'm sure.
So... do you like the new outfit?
I haven't gotten a great look.
I like this one... It reminds me of the older one.
I like these too. They're a lot more revealing than the ones I saw this morning.
The ones for practice show less. Actual gameday ones look more like this.
Oh, makes sense.
Here... I'll show you what they'll look like in an actual cheer pose.
Wow, they look great on you Emiko. Where's that shy girl that was hiding a few days ago?
She has caffeine now.
Mhmmm... I'm sure that's it.
They really do look great Emiko.
Good... we're voting on our favorites.
I'm assuming you're voting for that one?
Yep... Natalie and Elizabeth don't like them as much. They say it hurts their boobs.
Ha, none of the outfits look very comfortable to begin with, much less for boobs.
It helps to have smaller ones.
I'm sure it does. But I should be getting these papers to Charles.
Oh, okay. I'll see you in practice then? You'll get to see the other outfits.
Sure will. I'll be there in just a moment.
At least Emiko is coming out of her shell to me.
I like her attitude. She can lift people's spirits.
Time to talk to Charles... find out how tonight is going to go.
Just nothing too crazy... please.
Hmmm... he's dressed darker than usual.
*Mumbling to himself*
Charles? Harper sent me here.
Oh! [mcf]...
Jesus... he looks out of it.
Charles... you're not looking so good. Are you okay?
I didn't know you were coming [mcf].
I ran over here for Harper... I have the papers you needed.
Good, thank you. And about why I'm not looking so good... I'm juggling a lot right now.
I didn't sleep much last night.
Why not?
Thinking about how to please everyone. I can never make those kids happy.
I give them an arm and they demand a leg to go with it.
I love them... I do. I just wish they weren't so spoiled.
Then my staff decides it's time for a vacation in the very first week of the school year.
But hey... that's enough moping around from me. Today should be celebrated.
Why's that?
Take a seat.
You haven't heard about the charity game? I assumed someone would've told you by now.
I don't believe so, no. But I assume we're going to be playing a basketball game for charity?
Nope, not basketball... bowling.
Bowling? Why bowling?
Charity game... it's just what you do.
We're going to take the team and cheerleaders down to a local bowling alley... you know, support small businesses and all.
Have a few of my rich friends there... the media side of things too.
We'll stream it. Let everyone see you in a more laid back scenario.
Is that what our plans for hanging out are?
Yeah... I had something else in mind but this will get us in a lot less trouble.
Not to say we can't still have fun at a bowling alley...
Plus this way I might actually stand a chance against you in a sport.
That's no joke... I've only been bowling once.
You might want to head there early and get some practice in. I'd hate to embarrass you in front of all of your fans like that.
I'll pick it up quick. What time do I need to be there?
9 p.m. at the latest. 8 p.m. if you want to get an hour of practice in first.
Phew... it's a good thing we don't have class today. I should have enough time to accomplish everthing today.
And man, I'm happy to hear it's something simple... and in front of a lot of people.
That really eases my mind.
I'll try to be there around 8.
Great... absolutely wonderful.
And speaking of wonderful things...
There's my beautiful niece.
Hi.
Oh shit... I didn't even hear her come in.
Hey Katie.
Go ahead don't be shy [mcf], tell her how beautfiul she is.
Yeah, she's a very attractive young woman.
Awh, thank you [mcf]. It's good to see you again.
Hmmmm...
Keep him company while I go look through the papers darling.
Yes uncle.
Sorry to leave but I have some things to do.
Oh I should really be getting back to practice.
Nonsense, practice doesn't start for another 20 or so minutes.
But I'll see you tonight [mcf].
Yep, you sure will Charles. Take it easy.
I guess I could ask Katie about Ryker...
I'm not sure if she's on his side or not so I shouldn't say too much.
Can I help you? I'm a very busy woman.
Mhmmm... what happened to the nice blushing girl from a moment ago?
When Charles leaves the room so does she.
Last time you were in here I was sitting on the floor.
And now you're a big girl in a big chair?
Ha, exactly. But really, what can I help you with? You would've found an excuse to leave already if you didn't want to chat.
It's about your brother.
Well that's a first... no one ever asks about him, they'd rather pretend he didn't exist.
What do you want to know?
What's his problem?
Other than being a rage filled lonely virgin? Not sure.
Why? Is he giving you trouble? That's just who Ryker is.
Yeah, something like that.
Tell him to fuck off... and don't worry about him.
Well she wasn't much help... or at least she's not going to tell me much.
So are you sticking around? If so...
I could really use a foot massage.
I'm not going to do that Katie.
Ha, keep dreaming. That won't be happening today.
Awh... come on.
Not even after yesterday? I think I'm owed a reward.
Weren't you the one that was stuck on the floor for a while?
Hehe, true.
What was fucked up about that was that a janitor ended up walking in on me while I was getting dressed.
Poor girl was so embarrassed. She wasn't supposed to be down there though.
Oh, what happened after that?
She apologized a ton of times. Then she went on her way.
She said she didn't even know what was down there. But why was she going there then?
I'm not sure? Maybe she's telling the truth.
Maybe. We're going to look into it anyway.
Yeah, that's how I'd handle it too.
So.... you have 20 minutes right?
Katie... now isn't a good time.
I have to go practice. Harper wants me back as soon as possible.
Ugh... why are you so lame?
You said Ryker was causing you trouble and I know you don't like Charles.
And you have the chance to fuck someone close to them to get back at them... and you're just so whatever about it.
It's so boring here, let me be a naughty girl for you.
Hmmm...
I do have a little less than twenty minutes... That's enough time if we're quick.
Fine. You want to be naughty?
Hehe, yes I do. But hmmmm.... But you have to get completely naked first.
Why? Do I have to take everything off?
Mhmm, it's more exciting that way.
Fuck it, I'm already here.
A few moments later
Ahh perfect... I missed this cock.
I'm a little sad you aren't already hard for me this time. But we can fix that.
Mmmm... gghh...
Heh, you really are naughty Katie.
Glll... mhmmm...
I'm growing in her mouth, she's just letting it happen... she's not moving anything but her tongue.
Grrrggghhh... Glll... mmmm....
Mmmm... I'm almost completely hard Katie... keep going.
You have great tits Katie... I like the dress but you should take it off.
Mhmmm...
Oh... I didn't mean that you had to stop.
How else do you expect me to take off my dress?
Good point, but I meant to take it off after you were finished.
Oh I'm finished... that was just to get you hard.
What do you want to do next?
I want you to stick your cock inbetween...
These.
They really are great tits.
I know. And you're a very lucky man since you get to look at them.
Am I the only one that gets to right now?
...
Actually yes... you are.
But don't let that go to your head.
You're handsome with a nice body and a nice cock.
So just enjoy the fun and don't worry about it.
Now take a seat... I'll even let you sit in my chair.
How kind of you.
We don't have a lot of time left by the way.
Well then hurry over here.
I'm surprised you can last as long as you have in the past...
I'm going to try and make you cum as quickly as possible.
Go for it.
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK
Katie? Are you in there?
Is that Ruby? Fuck...
Shhh...
I think I locked the door. She'll go away.
AHH!! [mcf]! What are you doing in here?!
Oh! I uhhh...
I came from a workout and had to talk to Charles.
Fuck... I hope she didn't see Katie.
I also hope she can't tell I'm completely nude.
[mcf]... are you some kind of nudist?
I won't judge you if you are...
What? No... you've just caught me at bad times. I'm sorry.
If you say so... uhh... do you know where Katie is?
I'm meant to talk to her about the charity game tonight. I'm going to help Moon cover it.
Good luck by the way.
Thanks Ruby... uhh... I think I heard she was in the library right now. It's worth a look.
Huh... I wonder why she's there.
I guess I'll go look. Thank you [mcf]. Sorry for walking in on you.
It's okay Ruby... I'll see you tonight.
Bye [mcf].
Phew... thankfully that wasn't anyone else.
Now Katie just has to run over to the library and everything will be okay.
You're not a great liar.
No, I'm really not.
Guess I should run over to the library. We'll continue this later.
See you tonight?
Mhmmm... now get dressed and get to practice.
A few minutes later
Nothing like getting the engine started then going nowhere...
I have a lot planned today so maybe it's best I don't overdo it.
I hope the girls are already in the gym.
Katie... put your feet down. This isn't happening.
Why are you such a weirdo?
If you can't even joke around then why are you still in my office?
I'll see you tonight Katie. Have a good day.
....
A few moments later
I hope the girls are already in the gym.
Oh good they are here.
Yeah I understand that Shauna. A night out is nice but I just want him to hold me for a while.
After everything that's happened this week, I could really use it.
Awh, they're talking about their plans with me later.
That does sound nice... but I really want an actual date.
I want to get dressed up for him, I want him to hold the door for me and pull my chair out.
I just want that whole experience.
Where do you hope he takes you?
He can take me anywhere. It could be fastfood and we eat in the car for all I care.
Any plans for after?
I hope something happens... but I haven't really planned anything.
Heh, neither one has noticed me... and I'm not sure how to jump into this conversation.
Oh nevermind, [g1] knows I'm here.
Maybe he can hold me for a while too... that does sound really nice.
Shhh...
All you would have to do is ask him.
I know. I just hate feeling like I'm asking for too much. He's so busy that I feel bad taking up too much time.
You know he doesn't see it that way.
Yeah... I don't know though. I'll take the date... if anything else happens then they do.
But I won't force it.
If that's what you want to do Shauna. I feel the same way a lot of the time but [mcf] has a weird talent for knowing what we really want.
Yeah, you're not joking. It feels like he somehow hears us talk all the time.
Uhh Shauna...
What?
Haha, look behind you.
Huh?
Ahh! [mcf]!
I had a weird feeling someone needed to be held so I got here as quickly as I could.
Heh! You're such a jerk!
No, no, no. You're the jerk for not telling me what you really want.
Hmmm...
Mwah!
There... we even now?
Hmmm... maybe.
But I'm excited for our date.
That goes for you to [g1]. 
Hehe, I'm excited too. Did you hear about our class being cancelled today?
Yeah I did. I have to give Willow a ride home because of it.
But as soon as I get home from that we'll have our date. Then me and Shauna will go out.
[mcf]! Good morning!
Good morning Skye. Why are you still in that outfit? Did they never give you another one?
Not yet... but it's no big deal. It covers everything it has to cover.
Hey, if it doesn't bother you then it doesn't bother me.
So who are the girls?
These are my girlfriends... [g1] and Shauna.
It's nice to meet you Skye.
It's nice to meet you too.
Wow... you're both his?
Mhmm we are.
Pssst...
Who is she?
Skye is actually a he. He's trangender.
Oh... is he on your team?
Yep, he's our newest teammate.
Oh... wow. There's a lot more people like me here than back home.
Yeah that's true. Although you two are a bit different, I don't think Skye cares about what his body looks like.
I wish I could say the same.
Well you should introduce yourself. Skye is a good friend to have for you.
Hey Skye. It's nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you too Shauna.
So how long has the love triangle been a thing?
Oh, it's not really a triangle. We're both his girlfriends but we are only friends.
Oh... hey, whatever works.
Hey [mcf]! You ready?
I'm always ready.
How do you feel about running a little triangle offense today?
Heh, I'm down. I've studied the playbook when I can.
Good. I'm going to be a more hands on coach today. Instead of just observing I'm going to start barking a bit.
Bark away coach.
Meet me at half court when you're ready.
I wonder how well the others know the plays...
I also wonder who all will show up today.
I was rusty yesterday. I won't go so easy on you this time.
Ha, good, it felt like I was against a grandpa yesterday... nowhere to go but up though.
Uh huh... I made you sweat.
Ha, yeah I sweat a bit. I'll give it to you.
I'll be over there in a second.
The workout before this was good. I feel energized.
We'll be over here if you need us babe.
We'll be your cheerleaders until the actual ones show up.
I wouldn't mind seeing you two in some cheer outfits actually.
Hmmm... maybe.
And you'll roll off of the screen either into the close corner or you'll take the screen and then run under the basket to the other corner.
Simple enough.
Am I playing shooting guard today? Or are we going to switch up?
We're going to swap you and Damien around at both guard positions, Lee will run some too. Kenji is playing center. The rest will be swapping around as forwards.
Sounds good.
Speaking of some others.
Woo! Let's play some basketball!
How's it going man?
Not bad at all.
Good morning.
Good morning Dubaku.
Another day to improve.
You get any sleep last night?
Yeah, much better. I started studying earlier and went to bed at a decent time.
Good, keep it up Ayden.
Hey...
Did you hear about Damien and Jasmine?
I heard they broke up.
That's none of our business Ayden.
I mean... it is if it effects Damien.
[mcf]!
Woah, Kenji.
I apologize for my disrespect. I'm humbled that I'll be able to learn from you.
Uhh... thanks?
That's strange.
It will be a good year. We will grow as a team. We will all trust each other.
Yeah, that's the plan.
Good, we are on the same page.
He's saying these things but they don't feel genuine.
You want to take the lead [mcf]?
You'll be the one on the court the most.
Yeah, I'll call the plays.
Good... and come here for a second.
fuck... I'm being pulled in every direction.
Before we start... Natalie and I will be at the charity game tonight.
Will you be playing in it?
Nah, I don't think so. But I hope we get some time to talk while we're there.
I'm sure we will.
Can I ask you something else?
Sure.
This will be Natalie's first day cheering in front of the team... you won't let them say anything about her right? Please?
Of course I won't Harp.
Good. And if you can... give her a compliment. It'll mean a lot to her.
I will Harp.
Okay, while we wait on the others go ahead and shoot around a bit. Warm up.
It's good to see everyone focused and into practice for once... even if we don't have everyone still.
Hmm, I haven't seen much of Kenji outside of running to the rim. I wonder if our big man can shoot threes at all.
Yo Kenji.
What is it?
Want to have a little shoot off? Just for fun.
We'll each get a rack and whoever makes the most threes wins.
Why?
Like I said, for fun. I haven't seen you play much outside of the box.
Are you trying to show off?
What? No? It's just a friendly game while we wait.
You really do think you're better than everyone don't you?
I will show you you're not. I accept your game.
What's your problem Kenji?
Hey, hey...
Don't argue, he accepted the game. I'll help you get the basketballs.
But...
Come on. You can't play without them.
Hmmm, okay...
It's not worth it. Kenji is just strange.
I talked to him some yesterday and he doesn't seem like your biggest fan.
Then why did he just apologize to me and say he wants to learn from me right before that?
Like I said, he's strange. Probably just an ego thing, we'll figure it out.
Maybe give him a few shots, let the game be close. You still get to see how he can shoot and you don't kill his confidence.
I guess I can do that. I don't want to feed his ego too much though.
Which is why you should still win... just let him get close.
I got this one... you grab the other one.
Where do you want this by the way?
Not the corners but the sides of the three point line.
I think I know what you mean.
Here you go Kenji. 12 tries, we'll alternate.
I don't shoot many threes.
Just try your best. No one is expecting you to hit all 12.
But you think you will?
I never said that and no, I don't think I will.
Well we will see.
You ready [mcf]?
You got this [mcf]! Hit all of them!
Heh, Ayden has been pretty chill. I should try to hang out with him sometime outside of practice.
To be honest that goes for all of the guys...
Yeah, I'm ready.
Who is going to shoot first?
Kenji can start.
KENJI! YOU GO FIRST!
Let's see what he can do... Harper's watching too so it's his moment to shine.
Damn, nothing but net.
Yes!
You got this [mcf].
My turn...
I should miss this one... let Kenji be ahead for a moment. I'll shoot a little short on this one.
Awh!
Woah [mcf].
I thought that one was going in!
I'm just dialing it in.
Ha, Kenji is staring me down while he's shooting now. Skye sounds right about him having an ego.
And he made it.
Wow! Good job Kenji, keep it up!
Come on [mcf]! You're only down by 2!
I'll miss one more... this time I'll shoot too far.
Oh! So close!
*whispering* not too far ahead [mcf]...
You okay man?
Everyone misses shots Ayden.
I think it's time to start hitting them.
You got this baby!
Score the bucket! Or whatever they say!
Oh, they were watching me miss those. It really is time to start making them.
Still dialing it in?
Yep, I think I have it now.
I trust it.
A few minutes later
Oh! So close Kenji! We'll work on your form.
This is fucking bullshit!
You still have one more shot [mcf]. You're already up by 2. Might as well make it 3.
You got this!
Wooo!
Ayyy! Final score is 9-6.
Phew, I made 9/10 of the ones I actually tried on... a few of them were lucky though.
I can feel myself getting rusty.
Good job [mcf].
Not bad [mcf]. Not bad at all.
Told you, I just had to dial it in.
I believed it.
I just hope this didn't escalate shit with Kenji... I didn't mean for it to.
Oh, Mackey and Lee are here.
Behind you Harp.
Oh! Good morning guys.
Good morning coach. What are we doing today?
We're going to practice our triangle offense. You three can talk for a moment and then we're going to start.
Yes coach.
So [mcf]. You excited to bowl tonight?
It sounds like fun I guess.
I heard they redecorated the bowling place for us. Are you ready for your introduction to the celebrity life?
What do you mean?
They aren't televising this for us... it's all about you.
Just be ready man.
Expect more than one camera pointed at you the entire time.
Anyway... did you hear about Damien and Jasmine?
I don't want to talk about it guys. It's not the time.
Let's just start practice okay?
Oh... yeah. Sure man.
Practice commences.
Practice continues.
Running screens is fun and all but we really should be doing more.
Plant those feet Ayden!
UHhgg!
Oh shit... Skye must not have seen Ayden... or he just decided to run through him.
Ahh!
Are you two okay!?
What happened?
Ha, yeah I think we're good.
Are you sure?
I'm so sorry Ayden! I didn't see you.
Haha, it's okay. It happens.
Not my first time falling down.
Let me help you up.
Help Skye get up first.
Thank you. I'll try to focus better.
We'll get there Skye. We're all still getting used to things.
Are you sure you're both okay?
Yeah we're good. We don't have to stop practice for me.
Are we ready to keep going?
I am.
A few minutes later
Everything has gone pretty smoothly since Skye's accident.
Everyone seems to have it down... even though we're only playing with six and only one side of the court.
But it's a start.
Ayden is going t-
What the fuck?
Ahhgghh!
[mcf]!!!
What the fuck Kenji!
Fuck... I landed weird. Under my shoulder hurts.
Baby!
What are you doing?!
I lost my footing.
You weren't even the one that was supposed to set the screen!
Are you okay???
Are you hurt?!
Just my shoulder... but I'm fine.
[mcf], you have to be hurt.
That looked really bad!
I'm fine girls... I just stretched a muscle.
Can you stand up?
Yeah, thanks Skye.
Are you sure you're okay?
He would tell us if he wasn't coach.
Can you at least check with the nurse? See what she says?
I don't need that coach. I'm fine.
Please? Just check?
Why wasn't Ayden shown this treatment?
We still have practice coach...
We're almost done. It's okay.
Please go see the nurse babe.
We know you'll act all tough guy and we won't know if you're actually hurt.
I'm outnumbered just like last time...
Might as well just go.
Sure girls... I'll go get checked.
Thank you.
Yeah, thank you...
Where are you girls going to be?
We're going with you.
Only two people are allowed there at a time. And I want Skye to take him over there.
Oh... well...
The cheerleaders never came out so we'll go say hey to them I guess. Since we can't come with you.
Come there as soon as you're out okay?
Okay girls... I'll see you two soon.
Bye baby.
Bye babe.
Heh, Shauna called me babe. Has she done that before?
You ready to go?
Yeah I suppose so.
I didn't mean to run into you [mcf].
I believe it Kenji... it's all a part of the game.
Glad you understand.
Thanks for going... it's an important day for you. I don't want you to be hurt on it.
I'll let Natalie know why you aren't here. We'll see you tonight.
See you tonight Harp. I want to talk to you about something later.
Hmmm... Now I'm curious... I look forward to it. Now go get checked.
Yes ma'am.
Time to say hey to the nurse again...
Wait, she works at the middle school... not here. So it's time to meet a new nurse.
a few moments later
Oh fuck, it's bright in here.
Well... here we are. The nurse will be here in just a moment.
How did you know where this place was anyway? Aren't you new here?
I had to see the nurse before I was allowed to try out for the team.
Oh, makes sense. Thanks for helping me up and for talking to Kenji for me by the way.
It's what a teammate does. You helped me up right before that. Now take a seat.
I'm going to head back now okay?
Sure. Thanks for bringing me.
Yep, and I know you're fine but I'll get Kenji back for doing that.
It's fine Skye. It happens.
You didn't see him run full speed straight into you. See you around [mcf].
Don't do anything stupid Skye. I'll see you tonight.
Hmmm, maybe Kenji did have bad intentions.
Or Skye is overreacting... I'm not sure.
All I know is that I'm going to turn down the light in here a little.
There we go.
Guess I'll just lay here until the nurse shows up.
A few minutes later
*Knock, knock*
Oh there she is.
She's definitely a lot younger than the other nurse.
Hey there. How can I help you today?
I had a little fall. My coach wanted me to come get my shoulder checked.
I'm sorry to hear that... and what's your name?
[mcf] [mcl].
Heh, I'm just messing with you. Of course I know who you are, they made me learn all about you.
I'll probably get yelled at for not being here as soon as you arrived.
I won't tell anyone.
Well that's very sweet of you. Would you please take your shirt off and explain what happened?
Uhh sure.
I'm Mabel by the way. It's nice to finally meet you.
It's nice to meet you too.
I just had an awkward fall on my side. I fell on my arm and it stretched out a bit. The muscle under my shoulder is sore.
How bad does it hurt?
Not that bad, just enough to be annoying.
They really are keeping you protected huh?
I know it's not that bad, but they insisted I come.
Well lay on your back... I'll help ease the annoyance with a little rub.
How does that feel?
Great... the pain is already going away.
You just needed a good massage... don't you have girlfriends to do this for you?
Ha, yeah I do.
I'm just teasing... I don't mind at all.
Do you want to know something?
What's up?
I'm your teacher's cousin.
Really? That's cool.
Yeah, she was nervous about you at first but now she only talks about how great you are.
And I heard about your little meeting with Nathan. That was really cool of you.
I hope I get to see him again soon.
I'm sure you will. Well... I think you're all done unless you need something else.
No, I think I'm good. Thank you Mabel.
I'm happy to help.
I want to say I hope to see you soon but that means you'd likely be injured so I won't.
Ha, I'll just visit sometime then.
Well you're welcome whenever.
That's good to know.
AHHHgggg!
Someone's coming and they're hurt.
Oh! What happened?
Kimmy hurt her leg...
It hurts....
I'll help you onto the bed.
What happened?
I was swimming and my leg started to cramp really badly and it won't stop.
Lay her down...
I'm treating both of my superstars in a single morning. It's a special day.
Is it your knee or thigh that hurts?
My thigh.
Lay flat on your back for me.
Huh... why is Penny here in her work uniform?
Pst... Penny.
Oh, hey [mcf].
What are you doing at WVM this early?
I deliver coffee and breakfast to a bunch of people every morning.
I usually deliver and then get ready for class but since it's cancelled today I have to head back to work.
Can you handle Kimmy for me? I need to head out.
Yeah, I can. Do you want me to walk you out to your car?
Heh, if you want to.
I'm going to walk Penny to her car Kimmy. I'll be right back okay?
Mhmmmm....
We'll be here...
I park a good bit away...
That's okay... I could use a walk.
Is it cool if I stop by the locker room and change really quickly?
Sure, that's fine.
A few moments later
So what's up Penny? We haven't talked since we went streaking.
Heh, I know... after that I figured I'd give you some space. I don't want to overstay my welcome.
What do you mean?
You're the superstar and I'm just a random girl that works at a diner. Your time is more important than mine.
And it would be silly for me to think you want to spend that time with me.
Come on Penny, I don't view life like that. You're just as important as me.
Don't say stuff like that.
It's hard not to feel that way...
Girls like me don't end up with guys like you.
Who says? And why did you run away after kissing me?
I shouldn't have done that without asking...
If you asked I would have said yes...
Oh!
...
Nothing to say? Now we've both awkwardly kissed eachother. So we're even.
Mhmm.
Now where's your car?
Who says? Anything could happen and even if it doesn't we could still be really close friends.
There's nothing wrong with you Penny. Don't think that way about yourself.
Thank you [mcf]...
Now where's your car?
Follow me...
I have to say something [mcf].
What is it?
You know how I told you I've read a ton of articles and interviews about you?
They were more than just entertainment... Your story about losing your father and not knowing the rest of your family really pulled me in.
I was fascinated by you and everything you were achieving despite where you started.
I was rooting for you... and everytime you won or lost I was watching and cheering from my room.
How long have you known about me?
Your second year of highschool. When your highlights were being shown everywhere.
When I found out about Shauna I started to like you even more and I got even more invested.
Now you're here walking me to my car. I try not to act star struck but I am.
My legs are wobbly just thinking about it.
So I just want to thank you for being you and giving this random girl motivation for all of these years.
You're welcome Penny. I'm glad I was that for you.
I must sound like a lunatic.
No, I understand.
Oh... we're at my car... please don't make fun of it...
Why would I? There's nothing wrong with it.
You're just saying that... it's old and rusty and barely runs.
Why would I ever make fun of you for that? It's a car and it runs... even if only barely.
I don't know... I'm just not proud of it.
You didn't sound like a lunatic before but now you do.
You're a college student working at a diner. This car is all you need right now.
Yeah... it's just not something to brag about.
If you say so.
Well, I guess It's time for me to go.
Would you like to sit for a minute? And talk?
Don't you have to get back to work?
I can be a little late...
If you're okay with that then sure.
You keep your car very clean huh?
I try to.
It's not easy since I transport so much food and drink in it every single day... but I try.
Ha, yeah I can imagine that being challenging.
Her little confession back there was sweet...
I want to spend a little time with her but I shouldn't take too long. I have to get back to Kimmy and my girls.
Ha, you're a little big for this car.
Yeah a little bit but it's fine.
Thanks for walking me out here... I know it was a long walk.
It's fine Penny... you want to know something?
What is it?
I think you look absolutely beautiful today.
[mcf]... that's nice of you. You're very handsome today yourself.
Do you get so tense everytime someone compliments you?
Pretty much, yeah.
Well you shouldn't... give me your hand.
I'll admit... I have a lot to learn about you. But I like you Penny.
You've been very open and honest with me and I want to be the same with you.
[mcf]...
Let me finish Penny. I could be wrong but I get the feeling that you're an overthinker so I want to lay my feelings out there now.
I think you're a girl with a ton of potential. I'm not sure exactly what you've been through but I think they've made you a little unsure of yourself.
But I wouldn't be in this car right now if I didn't think you were a special person.
I like you a lot and I'd like to pursue something with you... but before that I need to know that you're okay with who I am.
And the type of relationship I have.
I know about it [mcf]. You don't have to explain.
Well... how do you feel?
Can you kiss me again?
Mmmm... it's nice to finally kiss her for real.
She's rubbing her hand on my thigh... we've already been naked together.
I might as well go for a little grab of my own.
Mmmmm... [mcf]...
She likes it and she moved her arm higher up my thigh.
I can't believe this is happening.
We should probably stop before we go too far... we're in public and you need to go back to work.
What? Fuck that... work can wait.
Are you sure?
Absolutely, they'll understand. I'll just tell them about Kimmy and how I had to help.
And no one ever comes this way this early. This parking lot is always empty. I promise.
So if you're okay with it then so am I.
Then I suppose I am too.
Can I... take your shorts off?
Yes you can.
I can't believe this.
Woah Penny...
I've thought about this since I saw all of you the other night.
Mmmm... I can grab it right?
You can do whatever you want to do.
Don't forget... I'm a virgin [mcf].
Go at your own pace Penny.
Don't worry... I'm ready.
Grrrgglll...
Mmmmm... yeah you're definitely ready.
Grrllll...
Damn Penny... there's no way this is your first blowjob. Mmmm.
She knows how to use her mouth but I wonder how deep she can take me.
MMMmmmm fuck... is this really your first Penny?
Grrlll... Mmmmmhmmm...
Well shit, you're a natural. Keep going.
I'm going to take my shirt off.
Grrggll
Fucking hell Penny, keep sucking me just like that.
You're so fucking good at it.
Grrgglllgrr
Mmmmm... She's sucking so fucking hard.
Keep going Penny.
Mmmmm...
She's almost as good as Shauna is. Ha, they actually do have a lot in common.
Mmmmnnnn... ggrrrggll...
I'm sorry... I have to stop for a moment.
Fuck Penny. That was great.
That's harder than it looks.
You didn't make it seem like it.
Was it actually good? I've never done anything other than test myself on a few objects.
Like I said, you're a natural.
Can we keep going?
What do you mean?
Like... can I take my clothes off?
Ha, you absolutely can.
Okay! Just give me a second. This uniform is hard to get out of.
I'm so excited... I'm shaking.
Calm down Penny. Nothing to be shaking about.
Yes it is...
There we go... I'm ready for whatever.
Your body is fucking sexy Penny.
Especially your thighs in those stockings.
Heh, I like how it looks too.
I'm a little lonely over here... is it okay if I come over there?
Yeah, I don't think I mind.
Just be easy with me... at first.
Of course.
I finally have Penny in my arms...
I'm ready [mcf].
Uhh... it's a little crammed. Could you help me?
It is really tight in here.
We can make it work Penny. It's not that bad.
I feel silly.
Do you want to try outside of the car?
Are you okay with that? It would be easier.
If you are I am. If someone shows I'm running though.
I'm pretty fast... I might be gone quicker than you.
Haha, we'll see.
What a fantastic ass.
Hey!
I'm starting to think you're trying to get me into exhibitionism.
Two experiences and both involve being nude in public.
Ehh... it makes it fun.
I won't deny that.
Do you want me to like... lay on the hood?
That could work.
I was calm... but I'm suddenly super nervous again.
Being exposed all around can do that.
Are you nervous?
A little bit.
Well at least I'm not alone. That makes me feel a little better.
It feels a little awkward just to bend over like this.
I'll help.
Woah [mcf]!
I told you I was helping.
[mcf]... I'm scared of heights.
Oh... my bad.
Thank you... at least I'm on the hood now.
Fuck it... here I go.
Mmmm... are you sure you want to start with this?
Mhmmm... please [mcf]. I'm ready. Take me.
Just go slowly at first.
Mmmmm....
Fuck... That's so big... mmmmm...
Slowly [mcf].
It's finally happening...
Are you okay Penny? I'm almost halway into you.
Only half? Holy fuck... Mmmnnnn...
I'm going to keep going slowly.
MMMNNNMMM!
Keep going... a little faster. Go all the way.
Uhh... I'm going to keep going slowly. I can feel her tensing up.
Mmmm... [mcf].
Ahh! [mcf], pull it out... it's starting to feel weird.
Fuck, we were so close. I should've stopped sooner.
I'm sorry... I've never had anything close to as big as you in me before.
It was shooting painful tingles through my legs.
It's fine... thanks for telling me to stop.
I ruined it...
It's fine Penny. It's not like these are pristine conditions. Losing your virginity is already stressful enough.
It's more about the position. I'm used to being on my back or knees. At least that's what I do anytime I've played before.
It's what I find most comfortable... I have a blanket in my trunk. If I lay it down can we try the ground?
Are you sure you're okay with that? It's fine if we just wait until later and try again.
I just want this to happen [mcf]. I don't care where or how. Please.
I mean... yeah, I'm down.
Hehe, okay.
Just give me a second... my trunk is hard to open.
There we go.
Huh, this isn't that bad. We're much more hidden than before.
I promise I'll do better this time.
You've already done great. Just relax and try to enjoy it instead of worry about it.
Mhmm...
It's a pretty thick blanket so it's actually pretty comfortable.
Really now?
Yep... you should find out for yourself.
I think I will.
Let me lay on my stomach first.
Okay, I'm ready for you.
Yeah, I'm ready too. You have such a nice ass and legs.
Just relax... I'll stop whenever you tell me to.
I'm relaxed... I promise. I can handle it now.
Please fuck me [mcf].
Oh fuckkkk... mmmm...
Damn, I'm sliding into her much easier than before.
This is so much better [mcf].
How do I feel?
Fucking perfect...
You can definitely tell she's a virgin by how she's reacting to everything.
She reminds me a lot of Jamie and Shauna's first time.
I'm about as deep as I can go in this position Penny.
You can go deeper?
Yeah, we'd have to change positions though.
What about me on my knees?
That'll be perfect.
Oh my god it feels even better this way.
And it's even easier to slide into her.
Your cock feels so good [mcf]...
I don't really like to go slow. Don't be afraid to go fast.
Are you sure?
I'll start at a moderate pace... nothing crazy.
Mmmmmmhmmmm...
Ahhhmmm... you're so big.
And you're so tight.
Is this a good speed?
Faster [mcf]... mmmm...
As fast as you can go... please.
Mmmm, I can't say no to that... I just have to be ready to stop if she needs me to.
FUCK!!! JUST LIKE THAT!
Fuck Penny...
Hard and fast! Harder!
I didn't think you'd be like this Penny.
HHHnnnngg! Keep going!
Am I good [mcf]?
Fuck yeah.
Mmmm...
That's so fucking good.
I could go faster but I shouldn't overdo it.
Fuck! This feels amazing!
I'm getting close [mcf]!
Hmmmnnnngg... you can cum in me. I'm on the pill.
I'm glad she said that, I really want to cum deep inside of her... and I'm getting close.
I shouldn't try to hold out, me and Penny both need to get on with our day.
I'm about to cum Penny.
Mmmmm... so am I... Don't stop...
HNNNgGhhh...
Oh fuck! I'm so close [mcf]! Don't stop!
AHHHHNNNGGGGGHHH!!
*Heavy breathing* MMmmmm... my body is shaking.
That was amazing.
Yes it was...
You were great...
Did you finish? I was so focused on myself and what it felt like that I couldn't tell.
Yeah, right before you did.
Would you do this again with me?
If we both had time I'd do it again right now.
Hehe... that was one hell of a way to lose my virginity.
Are you happy this happened the way it did?
Of course.
Mwah!
It was totally worth whatever trouble I'll be in with my boss.
Ha, I hope it was. How do you feel?
Tingly... all over. And very happy.
Should we get dressed now? I feel like our luck may run out soon.
Yeah, we probably should.
Especially your thighs in those stockings.
Heh, I like how it looks too.
The other thing there isn't a problem for you right?
I've seen you naked before Penny... it's not a surprise or anything and you know I don't mind.
I know... I just wanted to make sure.
How has Shauna been? Does she still not like having one?
Not really, no. But we're working on it.
She's very lucky to have you. I went through something similar when I first started to transition.
And I had to find who I really was on my own, but even then I'm not so confident in it right now.
What do you mean?
Part of me wishes I didn't have it right now... because of you.
That's nonsense Penny.
I promise I don't mind Penny.
[mcf]! Stop!
What is it?
Have you done anything with Shauna's yet?
Not really...
You should do this with her first... before me.
Okay, I'll stop. I was just trying to prove a point.
Sorry...
It's fine. You're right, I should do that with Shauna first.
Anyway... where were we?
I promise I don't mind.
I believe you.
Anyway... where were we?
I'm a little lonely over here... is it okay if I come over there?
Yeah, I don't think I mind.
Just be easy with me... at first... and there's lube in the glove box.
You carry around lube in your glove box?
Haha, Don't judge me.
I finally have Penny in my arms...
I'm ready [mcf].
Uhh... it's a little crammed. Could you help me?
It is really tight in here.
We can make it work Penny. It's not that bad.
I feel silly...

I told you I was helping.
[mcf]... I'm scared of heights.
Oh... my bad.
Thank you... at least I'm on the hood now.
Fuck it... here I go.
What a nice little asshole.
Mmmm... are you sure you want to start with this?
Mhmmm... please [mcf]. I'm ready. Take me.
Just go slowly at first.
Mmmmm....
Fuck... That's so big... mmmmm...
Slowly [mcf].
It's finally happening...
Are you okay Penny? I'm almost halway into you.
Her ass is so fucking tight.
Only half? Holy fuck... Mmmnnnn...
I'm going to keep going slowly.
MMMNNNMMM!
Keep going... a little faster. Go all the way.
Uhh... I'm going to keep going slowly. I can feel her tensing up.
Mmmm... [mcf].

Okay, I'm ready for you.
Yeah, I'm ready too. You have such a nice ass.
Just relax... I'll stop whenever you tell me to.
I'm relaxed... I promise. I can handle it now. Last time was a fluke.
Please fuck me [mcf].
Oh fuckkkk... mmmm...
Damn, I'm sliding into her much easier than before.
This is so much better [mcf].
How do I feel?
Fucking perfect...
You can definitely tell she's a virgin by how she's reacting to everything.

Hmmmm...
I don't really like to go slow. Don't be afraid to go fast.
Are you sure?
I'll start at a moderate pace... nothing crazy.
Mmmmmmhmmmm...
Here I go...
Ahhhmmm... you're so big.
And you're so tight.
Is this a good speed?
Faster [mcf]... mmmm...
As fast as you can go... please.
Mmmm, I can't say no to that... I just have to be ready to stop if she needs me to.
FUCK!!! JUST LIKE THAT!
Fuck Penny...
Hard and fast! Harder!
I didn't think you'd be like this Penny.
HHHnnnngg! Keep going!
Am I good [mcf]?
Fuck yeah.
Mmmm...
That's so fucking good.
I could go faster but I shouldn't overdo it.
Fuck! This feels amazing!
I'm getting close [mcf]!
Hmmmnnnngg... Cum in my ass [mcf]!
I'm glad she said that, I really want to cum deep inside of her... and I'm getting close.
I shouldn't try to hold out, me and Penny both need to get on with our day.
I'm about to cum Penny.
Mmmmm... so am I... Don't stop...
HNNNgGhhh...
Oh fuck! I'm so close [mcf]! Don't stop!
AHHHHNNNGGGGGHHH!!
*Heavy breathing* MMmmmm... my body is shaking.
That was amazing.
Yes it was...
You were great...
Did you finish? I was so focused on myself and what it felt like that I couldn't tell.
Yeah, right before you did.
Would you do this again with me?
If we both had time I'd do it again right now.
Hehe... that was one hell of a way to lose my virginity.
I've never came from anal by myself before... that was crazy.
Are you happy this happened the way it did?
Of course. Without a doubt.
Mwah!
It was totally worth whatever trouble I'll be in with my boss.
Ha, I hope it was. How do you feel?
Tingly... all over. And very happy.
Should we get dressed now? I feel like our luck may run out soon.
Yeah, we probably should.
I'll get them out of the car.
Thank you.
Woah... take your time Penny.
Are you staring at my ass?
I most definitely am...
*You both get dressed*
Can we lay here for just another minute? I don't want this to end.
It's only beginning Penny. But yes we can.
Come closer.
Is this good... are you comfortable?
Yeah, I am.
What would the younger version of yourself do if you told her that this day would happen?
She would freak out and...
And what?
Probably think about it while masturbating...
Haha, have you done that before? Think about me while masturbating?
Heh, don't make me answer that.
Ha, I won't. But I'll assume it's a yes.
You go ahead and do that.
I'll lay here for a minute and then I have to go.
Sounds good to me.
A few minutes later
Thank you for helping me put the blanket back... and thanks for this.
I'll never forget this morning.
I won't either Penny. I hope we get to do it again soon.
So do I. I'll be watching and rooting for you tonight. Good luck.
Heh, thanks. I'll probably need it. I'll see you soon Penny.
Goodbye [mcf].
Penny was a surprise. Once she got comfortable everything went smoothly...
I bet me and her are going to have a lot of fun together this year...
I should head back and check on Kimmy. She may need someone to help her out when she leaves.
Thanks again for walking me to my car.
No problem Penny.
I'll be watching and rooting for you tonight. Good luck.
Heh, thanks. I'll probably need it. I'll see you soon Penny.
Goodbye [mcf].
Penny is cool... I didn't expect her to tell me about her watching me for years on this walk but that was really sweet.
I really need to go to the diner soon.
I could take Shauna there but I want us to have alone time together.
I should head back and check on Kimmy. She may need someone to help her out when she leaves.
A few minutes later
I hope Kimmy is doing okay...
Mabel is probably doing the same thing for her that she did for me.
I'm almost to the nurse's room.
Oh... yep... same thing she did for me.
I just didn't expect that position.
Is it getting better? My hands are getting tired.
A little.
How's it going you two?
[mcf]... what took you so long?
It was a long walk. How's your thigh?
It hurts.
Do you mind giving me a hand? After your shoulder and now her thigh... my arms are exhausted.
You want me to rub her thigh?
To help with her cramp? Yes.
You have stronger hands, you could probably help more.
Please [mcf].
I mean, I will. I'm not sure what I have to do though.
Just massage her thigh, Get in deep.
You're cool with me touching your thigh Kimmy?
Mhmmm... I just want the pain to stop.
How does that feel?
A little better.
You need to get more force [mcf]. Sit how I was... it helps.
If you say so...
Fuck... I have to be careful like this... I have my hips foward so nothing is touching her except my butt.
Kimmy put her hand over her groin too... so that helps.
How about now?
Mmmmm... mmmhmmm... it's helping.
Hehe... put more body weight into it. Try rocking her leg a bit while you do it.
Why?
Are you questioning the nurse in the room?
Mmmm...
No it's just... okay I'll try it.
Thank you... you're doing a good job. She's really close.
HHHmmmmm....
Damn... this must feel really good for Kimmy. Mabel knows what she's talking about.
Hmmmnnn... hmmm...
Let me try a little harder.
HHHHHNNNGGGGMMMM!!
Woah...
There you go!
Oh my god! I'm sorry!
What happened?
Uhh... I have to go.
Thank you for helping... I feel better.
No problem but what happened?
I'll see you later.
What the fuck just happened?
Do you really not know?
No, I don't.
I'm pretty sure you just made her cum.
What? How? I was just massaging her thigh. And it wasn't even for long.
If you want to believe you made her cum from that then you go ahead.
But I'd bet it's because you were sitting on her hand that was placed over her vagina... and you were rocking back and forth.
You told me to?
I didn't think she'd cum from it. Plus Kimmy is the most tense and strict person I've ever met... she probably needed it.
I didn't mean to do that.
It's fine. It felt good for her and she might be embarassed but it will go away.
Everyone needs a little thigh rub from someone like you every now and then.
Including you?
Heh, I could report you for saying that.
And I could report you for not being here when I got hurt... and what you just had me do with Kimmy.
So I think we're even.
Hmmmm... I don't know about that. I think you should come by again soon and we can talk about it further.
Wow, that actually worked...
I was mainly just teasing her... with all the scandals and stuff I have to be careful with the staff here.
Ha, we'll see about that. Thanks again Mabel.
Anytime, I hope to see you soon big guy.
I guess so...
Don't worry about it... I highly doubt it will be an issue in a few days.
You're probably right. I'll still talk to Kimmy about it.
Hey, that's up to you.
I'm going to head out... thanks again Mabel.
Anytime... I'll see you around.
Well shit... I didn't expect any of that to happen.
I still have to go by the cheerleader room. I'm not sure if the girls will still be there though.
A few minutes later
Oh... it's only Zoe.
Zoe!
About time you showed up.
You were waiting on me?
Yeah, your girlfriends said you would stop by here so someone had to tell you where they are now. They're at the front waiting on you.
They already stopped by the nurse and she told them you were walking Penny to her car and that you were fine.
You know... a note would have worked? Or a text?
Maybe I wanted to talk to you.
Anything specific?
Not really... all of my girls are pretty nervous since they'll be on tv tonight.
Are you nervous?
Yeah, a little.
Not so much for me, I'm nervous for them. I hope they do well.
I'm sure they will. Will you be performing anything or are you just going to be on the side?
Both, we're going to do a little routine to start everything off.
Oh, that's cool.
Anyway... what's up with you?
We had sex and now we've barely talked to eachother.
I've been really busy... and I thought you said you didn't want to be a girlfriend to me?
I don't... I just want a little attention.
No one wants to feel used.
Don't feel that way Zoe. We can talk anytime that you want to.
I'll remember that.
Is a hug all I can get?
What else do you want?
Just a simple kiss.
Mwah!
I think you'll like it.
I can't wait to see it.
Oh... I didn't mean to interrupt anything.
You're fine Emiko.
How's it going Emiko?
I'm worried about tonight... I need to go and get ready.
It's a long time away still.
I know, I just want to make sure I'm ready for it.
We'll head back to our room soon. You can go ahead and go and I'll meet you there okay?
Mhhmmm...
I guess I'll see you tonight then.
Don't worry too much Emiko. I'm sure you're going to do a great job.
Thank you. I hope so too.
I'll see you then.
Bye Emiko.
*Whispering* Thank you for saying that to her.
I mean it, I think she'll do great.
You know... ever since you had your first chat with her about how you'll protect her... I think she's grown a real crush on you.
She told you about that talk?
She tells me everything. All I'm trying to say is that your words of encouragment mean about the most of anybody to her.
I think so too.
I'm a bit shocked you haven't made a comment about the stripper pole.
Why is it in here?
It's great exercise... and our cheer room used to be a generic dance studio.
Can I get a little show?
Hmmmm... perhaps.
Fuck it... sure. I'll even make the show better.
A pole is only as good as the pair of boobs that is swinging on it.
Then that's one fan-fucking-tastic pole.
You think so?
Yep, I sure do.
Heh... now stand back and enjoy the few things I know how to do.
Zoe is really sexy. It's too bad that she doesn't want anything serious.
Or at least that's what she says.
What do you think?
I think I'm jealous.
Of what?
That pole.
Hehe...
I don't know a lot of moves. We mainly joke around on it.
I'm enjoying the show... so don't worry about it.
Heh, I do know one other thing.
It's a real shame that you're wearing panties right now.
Shhhhh... just come here.
How do you feel right now?
Excited.
Yeah, I bet so...
I am too... it's been hard to think about much else since our last time.
I'm a little dissapointed... I don't believe there are any pens nearby to reenact last time.
Don't even think about it!
Hmmm... I think I'm going to slide down a little bit.
Woah... Jesus [mcf].
You're so hard... I can feel you poking me through my panties.
Actually, that's just a really large pen in my pocket.
Haha, we can drop the pen jokes anytime.
There's something else I'd like to drop.
Go for it then... no one's gonna stop you.
Woah [mcf]... you got those off of me way too easily.
Is that an issue?
Ha, no. It was strangely impressive. That skirt isn't easy to get off.
So what happens next?
There's something I want to do.
Ohhh... fuck [mcf].
Mmmmmm...
Eating out Zoe is great, she smells so nice and she honestly tastes great too.
[mcf]... wait.
You're really fucking good at that... but I need to get to my room soon.
You're welcome to do this any other time but...
You're hard as a rock and I'm horny as fuck. So... let's fuck.
That's all you had to say.
You're really fucking hot [mcf].
So are you Zoe.
Are you going to be holding onto that pole this whole time?
Well... I have something else helping keep me up right now.
Ha, yeah I guess you do... I have other plans for that though.
I'm ready [mcf]... I missed your cock.
I'm lined up... Zoe seemed a bit inexperienced last time so I should hold myself back at the start.
AAHHHNNN!!
She just pulled me into her with her legs!
Holy shit Zoe... I wasn't expecting that.
Ohhhhhmmmm... your cock feels so fucking thick in me.
That's exactly what I needed.
If she wants to play like that...
Then I'll just have to play the same way.
You ready Zoe?
Fuck yes.
Mmmmmm!!
Oh fuck!
Is that what you wanted?
Mmmm... oh fuck yes....
Fill my pussy with that huge fucking cock... Fuck...
Mmm... Ohhhhh...
How is sex with someone on a pole?
It's fucking great. Are your arms tired?
Mmmnnn... I can hang here and get fucked like this all day.
Mmmnnnn... Ohhhh...
Just like that [mcf]... I'm going to fucking cum.
Mmmmnnn.... MMMMMM.... MMMMOOhhh...
FUCK! AHHHHNNGGGGHHH!
I can't hold on!
Let go, I've got you.
Holy fucking shit... that was just what I needed.
Can you keep going?
Mhmmm... please keep fucking me.
She's sticking her tongue down my throat while I fuck her.
She's moaning straight into my mouth.
Ohhhhhmmm... Ahhhh...
You're so fucking tight.
Mmmm... you're holding and fucking me like it's nothing.
Fuck... I'm... already about to finish again...
Mnnnnmmm...
I'm about to finish too Zoe.
Mmmmm... hold on. I'm so close.
MMMMMNNNNN.... AHHH FUCK!
HHHNNggggg...
Fuck... that was so fucking good...
MMMMMNNNNN.... AHHH FUCK!
HHHNNggggg...
Fuck... that was so fucking good...
Fuck [mcf].
It's not fair the way your cock feels in me. What else can compare to it?
Ha, so last time was on a desk and this time was hanging from a pole.
How do we one up that?
We'll find a way. I have plenty of ideas.
Ohhh fuck... my legs are weak.
Do I need to pick you back up?
No, it's fine.
I have to get going. Emiko will wonder where I'm at.
Yeah, I need to go too.
Thanks for this... I honestly did need it.
Trust me, anytime Zoe.
Heh... noted.
*Both of you get dressed*
So I'll be seeing you tonight?
Yep.
Cool... see you then.
Woah, where are you going?
What? The locker rooms are right next door. I can be shirtless.
No, not that. I want a goodbye kiss.
Oh...
Sorry... I'm in a hurry. I forgot.
Mwah!
There... now I'll see you later.
Bye Zoe.
Hey... back up for a moment.
What are you about to do?
I'm about to leave. I have to go.
Woah, really?
Hold up.
I really have to go [mcf].
I'm sorry for teasing.
I mean yeah the teasing is a bit fucked up.
I just want a proper bye at least.
Like a goodbye kiss?
Yeah something like that.
Mwah!
There... now I'll see you later.
Bye Zoe.
Well... I hope you know how to bowl.
I roughly do... not great though.
Ha, you better practice. I'd hate to see you suck in front of everyone.
I'll do my best.
Well... I'm going to catch up to Emiko before she gets too far away.
All right Zoe. I'll see you tonight.
Bye [mcf].
Well... there's nothing left to do in here.
Time to go find my girls.
Zoe said they would be at the front... I assume she meant the front of the school.
I've taken enough time, they're probably ready to go.
Oh... what is Bailey doing in the hallway?
She doesn't notice I'm here...
Huh, she still doesn't. Either she's zoned out or she's thinking deep about something.
Pssstt..
Oh my god!
You scared the shit out of me [mcf]!
Haha... my bad. What are you doing waiting in the hall anyway?
I was waiting on you to walk by.
What's up?
Well I just wanted to talk...
And... I thought about what you said about Rainn.
Yeah? And what do you think?
Are you sure it's okay I tell her?
Absolutely Bailey.
Then I think I'm going to tell her that I like her too.
But I'd have to make sure she's okay with a few things.
The most important one being that she'd have to be okay with me dating you.
I'm very glad to hear that.
I think she will be... she seemed to like you.
If she agrees we should all talk about it though.
Yeah, you're right.
And who knows? Maybe you and her could grow closer and we could all have our own little thing?
Well that's up to Rainn. First things first is that you have to tell her how you feel. We'll worry about the rest later.
Yeah, that's the hard part though.
You can do it Bailey.
You know you're the absolute best for letting me do this right?
Yeah, well so are you.
Mwah!
So... what else did you want to talk about?
Well... Just like everyone else I'm nervous about tonight.
You've got nothing to be nervous about... at all.
Just like everyone else I'm nervous about tonight.
You've got nothing to be nervous about... at all.
I thought you might say that. I'm excited for it... but I still feel nervous.
I'll say it again... you have nothing to feel nervous about.
Are you checking me out?
Yes I am. I like the outfit.
Well what's underneath the outfit isn't recovered from last night yet... but that wouldn't stop me from doing it again really soon. Maybe after bowling?
Maybe... It's possible.
Heh, I hope so. I'm going to head home now, I'll text you in a little bit okay?
I'll see you tonight Bailey.
Mwah!
All of the girls I've talked to are nervous for tonight.
I wonder how Natalie is handling it...
Okay... now I'll find my girls.
They should be around here somewhere.
There they are... what are they doing?
She'll be out shortly.
Yeah we'll stay here with you until then.
[mcf]!
Nathan? What are you doing here?
My mom had to talk to someone.
There you are baby... how's your shoulder?
It's fine. It really wasn't bad.
I'm glad. How do you know Nathan?
He's Veronica's nephew. We played basketball the other day.
How have you been buddy?
Good. Are we going to play again soon?
Yeah, we will. Have you been taking care of your mom?
I've been good. I wrote her some letters and I've been trying to help clean more.
Good job buddy, I'm proud of you.
Have you met his mom? He was standing alone up here when we got here and it's been a while since then.
He was getting a little worried so maybe you could find her?
Also I'm glad your shoulder is fine.
I'm fine.
I can wait here. She'll be back.
So when are we going to play again?
Well I'm pretty busy... you'll have to ask these girls if it's okay if I set aside some time to play.
[g1] can [mcf] play with me sometime?
Am I allowed to come and play too?
Sure.
Then anytime. I don't mind.
Shauna... you can come too. Can he play sometime?
Sure he can buddy.
Can [mcf] play sometime?
Huh, Liz must have never introduced herself.
Oh... I'm not... uhhh....
Nathan! Where did you go?
You told me to wait at the front.
I meant in front of where I was. You had me worried sick.
It's okay! [mcf] was here!
Uhh.. It's nice to meet you.
Oh wow... it's nice to meet you too. My name is Vanessa.
Thanks for keeping an eye on Nathan... I didn't notice he wandered off until I was stuck in a conversation.
Come on honey, we have to get you to school.
[mcf] said we were going to play again soon.
Oh wow. Isn't that great? When did you two want to?
Well, I was going to ask you when would be a good time.
It's hard to say right now. Is it okay if I get your number from my sister?
That way I can call and plan something with you?
Yeah, that's fine with me.
Cool, I wish we wouldn't have met when I'm in such a rush.
It's okay, I understand.
I'll see you soon!
Yep, be good in class today and be good for your mom.
I will. I promise.
Bye buddy.
Bye [mcf].
I'm sorry for the wait girls... are we all ready to go?
Yeah, we're ready. Willow is already in the car.
Why is she out there and not in here with you guys?
She said she wanted to be alone...
It was really cute seeing you with Nathan.
I really do think you'll be an amazing father one day.
He's a good kid.
So... about our date.
When are we going to go on it?
Ha, I'm going to drop you girls off and then take Willow home. After I get back we'll go on our date okay?
Heh, good. that gives me enough time to get ready.
Hey [mcf]...
You should try talking Willow into staying with us for a while...
I think it could help her... and I wouldn't mind having her around.
I already talked to [g1] and Shauna about it. They're both okay with it.
I'll see what I can do Liz.
Thank you [mcf]. We should go out there now...
Yeah we should. Let's head home girls.
A while later
I've already dropped off the other girls... it'sjust me and Willow now.
She's been quiet this entire car ride.
I've tried to talk to her a few times but she's stayed silent.
We're not too far from her house now.
I wish I knew what was troubling her so badly.
She says I can't help... but I'd at least like to try.
That's not up to me though... I just have to be here for her when I can be.
Maybe she'll trust me enough to let me know more soon.
The weird thing is she keeps looking over at me...
I feel like she is right now...
Yep.
But everytime I look over she quickly looks away.
I don't want to make her uncomfortable. She probably just wants to get home and relax.
Oh, that's a nice car.
And the girl driving it is cute too... I feel like I've seen her before.
Hmmm... the roads have been pretty empty today.
Come to think of it a quiet drive is exactly what I needed.
This morning hasn't given me any breaks.
This entire week hasn't... tomorrow should slow down some.
I haven't gotten to train much at all this week... and practices haven't been very effective.
I think I'm going to try and get some work in tomorrow.
Uhhh... [mcf].
Oh, what's up Willow?
Uhh...
I'm sorry for ignoring you...
I get it, you're going through some things and sometimes you just don't want to talk.
You don't have to apologize for that.
I should have at least said I didn't want to talk instead of not replying at all.
Yeah, that's true. But it's no big deal.
I'm not one to get too offended by slight issues, especially if I understand why they're happening.
I don't usually go this way... are we close to my home?
Yeah, not far away now. We'll be there in just a moment.
Well... at least she apologized for it.
Time to finish this drive and get her home.
A few minutes later
Thank you for driving me home...
Do you want to come inside for a minute?
Ehh... I really need to get on with my day... but I know how much she didn't want me to leave last time.
Sure, I'll come in for a moment.
Okay...
She won't talk to me but she wants me to stay at her place...
She either likes me or hates being alone... maybe both.
So... what do you want to do?
I don't know... I feel a little weird.
Why?
I don't like being the main attention source. I know you're wondering what the hell is wrong with me...
I just don't want to talk about it but I feel like it's going to happen anyway.
We don't have to if you don't want to Willow. I am here for you though.
We can do something that doesn't involve anything like that.
Hmmmm....
Do you want to watch tv or something?
Sure, we can do that.
Will Ryker flip out if he finds out I was here?
Why would he?
You said you two were dating?
Oh my god... no. I was being a bitch when I said that. It was a lie.
Ryker has always been a creep... especially to me so I figured it would be easy to sell.
I knew you had just hit him and I needed help with something... so I tried to trick you into it.
What the hell Willow? You could have just asked.
I know that now... I'm sorry.
Sit down.
Feel free to sit down.
She seems really nervous.
Is it okay if I sit beside you?
Last time I was here you sat in my lap. Sitting beside me is fine Willow.
Oh, right.
So what do you want to watch?
It doesn't matter to me. I don't watch much tv.
I'll scroll through some channels then.
Anything but the news... well as long as it's not about me then I don't mind.
Give it a second... it always shows that screen when it's turning on.
Good afternoon everyone! My name is Moon and I'm here to catch you up on everything happening at WVM!
Oh no...
I'm sure you've heard about the bowling event tonight! Make sure to tune in and watch our very own star [mcf] and his teammates participate in a bowling tournament for charity!
You can turn the channel Willow.
No, no. I want to hear about this.
In the meantime we've hit the streets and asked around about how excited everyone is for the upcoming basketball season.
Here's a clip from one of those interviews.
Does it get annoying being talked about all the time?
I'm not a huge fan of it.
It's netted you some girlfriends and every girl at school talks about you like you're straight out of a romance novel.
So it must have some positives to it.
Heh, fair point.
You said you were a big fan of the Stars... How excited are you for the upcoming season?
Well I'm more of a fan of [mcf]. I've been following him on social media for a few weeks now and I think he's really hot.
Those girls of his are cute and all but he could use a bigger girl in his life.
Oh wow, they're even airing your fan girls on the news.
I expected nothing less.
I have an interview planned with [mcf]. What do you think I should ask him?
Oh... I'm not sure. I don't really have anything to ask him.
Okay not a question then... what would you like to tell him? I'll pass it on.
Well... that he's hot. And that big girls deserve some love from him too.
I can show him this interview, what's something that can make you stand out from all the other girls?
Uhh... what do you mean?
Why should he consider dating bigger girls?
He's a big boy so he needs someone who can keep up with him.
And we're curvy in all the right places.
What's something that can seperate you from the other big girls?
I can do this.
Oh my god!
Why isn't she wearing shoes?
I think [mcf] will be very impressed.
She's losing her balance!
Oh fuck...
Ahhh!
Cut it! Cut it!
Holy shit! That was amazing!
Haha!
Come on Willow, she might've gotten hurt.
Haha, They wouldn't show it if she got hurt too badly. And no one said she had to do all of that.
And did you see her feet?! That was crazy!
Ha, Yeah? What's so great about your feet Willow?
...
Oh she must have not liked me grabbing her ankle.
Sorry...
I meant that it was funny that she was outside barefoot.
I wasn't making fun of her weight or anything... I wouldn't do that.
What she did was silly though. Don't make me feel bad for laughing at that.
Yeah, it was silly.
Fuck... I made it a little awkward.
I think that's enough tv for me. That's all I needed to see.
Don't leave yet...
What else do you want to do?
I don't know...
There's a volleyball here... do you play?
Oh... uhhh... kind of?
I used to.
Were you any good?
Yeah, I suppose so.
Why'd you quit?
Do you want to play? We can pass it back and forth.
Huh... she dodged the question.
Sure, let's head back outside.
We can pass it in here... I don't mind.
What if we break something?
We won't... and I don't really care if we do.
You hit it first.
I've never actually hit a volleyball before... it can't be that hard.
Here we go!
That felt pretty good.
Jesus [mcf]! Hit it at me not over me!
My bad!
Damn, she hit it back to me even though my pass sucked... that was impressive.
Hopefully this hit is better.
Not bad! Hit it a little harder!
Oops!
Her pass was a little off. But not as bad as mine.
She said to hit it a little harder...
Oh, I fucked that one up.
I got it!
Oh fuck!
Willow!
Ow...
I'm sorry... that was an awful pass.
Haha, you fucking suck at volleyball... stick to basketball.
Now help me up asshole.
Hah, you're okay right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I shouldn't have went for that.
Your hits need some work.
Ha, Next time we'll play a game of horse and see who is talking at the end of it.
Haha, deal.
I landed on my elbow... it's sore.
Do you want me to take you to an urgent care?
No, it's just sore.
I can take you if you need to go.
It's really not bad. I just said it to make you feel bad... hehe.
Can I get you back?
How?
Let me punch your stomach.
Why?
Come on, you got me hurt now let me make it even.
Just one punch.
Ha, okay. One punch.
No flinching!
Ow!
What the fuck?
That's all you got?
Why is your stomach so hard? Did that not hurt at all?
I'll give it to you, it stung a little.
Ha, then we're even.
Let's sit back down... before we actually break anything.
Shouldn't we clean up the mess we already made?
I'll get it after... don't worry about it.
Same spots... I'll turn on a movie or something.
She seems to be in a way better mood than when we were in the car... but I need to leave.
So what do you want to watch? I'll let you pick...
Willow... I have a lot to do today.
Oh...
Okay...
Fuck. I can't leave with her looking at me like that.
Why don't you just come over to our place?
I will soon. But not today [mcf]...
Okay not a movie. What about a show? only 30 minutes?
Hmmm... okay Willow. I can do that.
A few minutes later
She's sitting really close to me.
I hate seeing her upset like this, especially when it's me leaving that's causing it.
I told Liz I'd try to talk her into staying with us. I don't think that's going to happen today.
I should still offer it... after the show.
around 15 minutes later
We've both gotten cozy. I don't mind that she's leaning on me.
She doesn't seem as upset now. I think she honestly just doesn't want to be home alone.
I feel a little guilty for taking back Liz... I wonder if she was doing better then.
Do you like the show?
It's entertaining... You look sleepy.
I am... but I don't want to fall asleep.
Why?
Because when I wake up you'll be gone.
Well I have to lea-
Shh... just lie to me.
Tell me you'll still be here. Please.
Damn...
Yeah Willow. I'll still be here.
Thank you.
Poor girl... something is really troubling her.
I'll let her fall asleep... and then I have to go.
After getting this comfortable I'm a little sleepy myself.
It might be worth resting for a moment. I still have a ton to do today, I doubt I'll be out for long sitting like this.
A few minutes later
Zzzz...
This way!
Huh?
Where am I?... Fuck, this has to be another dream.
What are you doing?
Is that my sister's voice?
This place looks so familiar... and I don't like it.
I don't think I should be here.
Brubru!
Follow me!
Cedey?
Why does she look like Stacy again?
I can't control anything... I'm following her.
Where are we going?
Woah she switched back... what the fuck?
Why do I feel so... scared?
These dreams make me feel anxious but they never really make me afraid.
What happened here?
I wonder what's in here.
Cedey! Don't mess with that!
She switched again.
We came here to find out what's in this place... it was your idea.
My idea?
Mom doesn't usually nap during the day. We need to hurry.
She'll be really mad if she finds out we snuck out.
Those boxes look new. I wonder if there's anything in them?
Oh no...
I'm going to slide them out.
Cedey no...
Come on, help me brubru. This bottom one is heavy.
CEDEY STOP! MOVE!
AHHH!!
RUN BRUBRU!
How did I not remember this?
But the dog wasn't the bad part?
KEEP RUNNING!
CEDEY! Watch out!
Oh...
I remember all of this now... and it was all my fault.
Cedey didn't get out of the way in time.
The pole falling was enough to scare the dog away though.
AAAAAHHHH!!!
It's all piecing together.
Everything is flooding back to me...
This is what caused my dad to take me and leave.
AHHHHHmmm!
NNmmmm...
Brubru... everything's okay. NNnn..
You need to go get mom okay? Be quick.
How was she able to tell me that? She had to be in so much pain but she was still trying to calm me down...
CEDAR! JACOB! WHERE ARE YOU!?
Cedar... my sister's name was Cedar.
OH MY GOD!
I'M COMING HONEY!
I'm so sorry! Are you okay Cedar?
It hurts mommy...
Jacob come help mommy.
Why is she calling me Jacob?
I'm so sorry.
Be strong for mommy honey, when I lift the pole you have to help pull your sister out okay?
Everything's going to be okay.
OHHHAAA!!
Cedey looks so much like Willow now... what's going on?
Oh my god... wake up [mcf]. I don't want to relive all of that again.
But it all makes sense now.
Oh thank god... it's over.
Willow is still out cold... how long was I asleep?
She seems like she's sleeping a lot better than I did.
Wait a second...
Nnnmmm... no...
Willow?
Don't... do it...
Hmnnmmm... let him go...
Brubru...
Did she just say Brubru??? Or did I just hear that?
There's no way...
She just sat up... did she wake up?
Willow?
Is she sleepwalking like I have been?
Willow!
Mmmmnnmmm.
Willow!
Don't... go...
Cedar!
Brubru...
Holy shit...
I can't believe this.
Cedey stop.
Willow! Stop her [mcf]!
Oh no... not again.
What are you doing here Lauren?
I come by everyday to check on her.
Help me lay her back down.
There we go... poor girl.
That's the second time I've caught her sleepwalking.
Is that what happened when I picked her up that one morning?
What happened in here?
A little volleyball incident.
So... we have to talk [mcf].
You and Willow haven't done anything have you? Like you're not in any sort of relationship right?
No, nothing like that.
Okay good. We should sit down for this.
I already know what she's going to say.
Willow is my sister. She's Cedar... there isn't any part of me that doubts that now. I can feel it.
How could I not tell before? And why didn't she look like herself in my past dreams?
How much do you know [mcf]?
I think I know Lauren. I just realized it.
Hmmm...
I had no clue until we had our own session. Both of you two told me pretty much two sides of the same story.
I couldn't just say that to you though. I had to make sure first.
But I couldn't find anything about when you lived here.
What do you mean when I lived here?
You're from here [mcf]. This is your hometown.
What the fuck...
My head fucking hurts... I haven't even begun to process the fact that she's my sister... now you drop that on me.
I know [mcf]... It's all as crazy as it sounds. But now you know.
You were here for your sister before you even knew.
She's going from being alone to having you as her brother. I think that alone will solve most of her problems.
And I'm happy for both of you guys. It's strange right now but I think this is a really beautiful thing.
I am happy... I'm just mad at myself.
Why?
I was the reason she got hurt as a child.
And there was nothing I could do about it... I just stood there and cried while they had to calm me down... and I wasn't even the one that got hurt.
Hmmm... that's not how she remembers it. But it doesn't matter now. It only matters what you do from this point onwards.
Do you think that's why you try so hard to protect everyone now?
Maybe?
Are we going to tell her?
Yes... I'm going to use her bathroom really quickly, then we'll wake her up and tell her. Okay?
Okay.
Fuck, I'm nervous.
What if she's mad? Or dissapointed?
I should go ahead and straighten this up.
A few moments later
Oh man... my heart is flying.
This feels like more of a dream than the one I just had.
I feel sick... it's my fault all of this happened.
She said she stopped playing volleyball... it had to be because of her injury.
Ugh... I feel awful.
[mcf]...
Oh no...
You didn't leave...
You promised me you wouldn't and you stayed...
You even fixed my kitchen.
You're the best.
Willow...
I didn't think you'd still be here.
I'm pretty hungry. Do you want me to cook us something? I'm not great at it.
Willow...
You made me really happy today [mcf].
This morning was awful but I'm feeling a lot better now.
Fuck... how do I tell her?
You deserve a thank you.
Mwah!
Heh...
Willow please...
Was that a good kiss?
I don't kiss just anyone.
Okay this will be awkward afterwards... Lauren please get out of the bathroom.
I don't want you to think any different! That was a very special kiss from me.
You better not think I'm some kind of easy chick!
Infact I'll let you know that I'm a vir-
Oh my god Cedey stop!
What?!
Oh fuck.
What did you just call me? How do you know that name?
There's no waiting for Lauren now, I have to just tell her.
It's me, Cedey.
Mom was calling me Jacob... I guess that used to be my name. I'll see how she reacts to it.
I'm your brother... I think I used to be named Jacob.
What? How?
Trust me... I know it's crazy. I just realized it myself.
What the fuck?
I don't know what to say... I don't even know what to think.
I had a feeling... but it was too crazy to be true.
You're my fucking brubru!
Oh my god you look so different... I was always taller than you.
I can't believe this!
Me either Cedey.
My memory on us as kids is super foggy.
Then you're lucky.
I have so many questions.
I do too.
Did you tell her?
Yeah, I had to.
Where did you come from Lauren?
I came by to check on you but you were asleep... and I had to use your bathroom.
She's holding me super tight.
I missed you so much. Heh... my brother is a star.
Brubru... never leave me again.
I don't think you two need me to get in your way right now.
Enjoy your day together. Catch up.
But I do think the three of us should talk tomorrow.
Sure Lauren. Thank you.
How do you feel Willow?
I'm so fucking happy.
I'm glad to hear it. I'll see you later okay? I think you're in good hands.
I think I am too. Goodbye Lauren.
Bye [mcf]. Call me tomorrow... or if you need me tonight.
I will. Goodbye Lauren.
I never thought I'd see you again.
Look at me Willow.
No... I'm crying too much and I'm embarassed.
I just realised what I said to you before you told me... oh my god.
Haha, I was trying to get you to stop.
And I don't care if you're crying. I want to see my sister's face.
There we go!
Come on Cedey... look at me.
I'm trying to wipe my tears on your shirt.
Haha, fuck... this is crazy.
I have so much to ask her but I don't want to rush into that.
I know right?!
I must still be dreaming...
Nope... this is real life.
We have so much to talk about.
Let me wipe my tears again first.
Mmm... better.
Uhh brubru?
What is it?
What happened to dad?
Oh, well... he passed away a few years after we moved. He was in a car accident.
I'm sorry...
Oh... it's okay. I hated him anyway... I just wanted to be able to tell him that myself.
So what happened to you?
I was very lucky. A woman named [am] took me in and raised me.
What about you? What happened to mom?
You'd have to ask her...
What do you mean?
Can we sit down again?
Sure.
Oh man... I never thought about the fact that she wouldn't have know about dad's death.
Sit...
I've heard your girlfriends talk about [am]. I'm really glad you had someone like her.
I was worried for you, I stayed up many nights hoping that you were okay.
But what happened to you?
It's not easy to talk about... will I have to tell [am] about it too?
You're going to meet her?
Of course I am. As your sister I want to meet the woman that takes care of you.
Heh, fair. Well then, yes you'll have to tell us both. [am] will flip out when she learns about you.
Really?
Oh yeah, she really wanted me to find you. So I'm excited to tell her.
Call her. Let's go tell her.
I'll go get changed into something nicer and brush my hair. You call her and tell her to meet us somewhere.
And I'll tell you both whatever you want to know.
Deal.
Fuck... my heart is pounding. I'm so overwhelmed with emotions right now.
[mcf] is my brother...
Not only did my brother find me but he's a fucking superstar.
Heh, listen to me. I'm starting to sound like that girl that got interviewed.
I'm happy we found eachother. However it happened... I'm just glad we're here.
I completely agree.
I'll be right back.
Don't you dare fucking leave.
I'm not going anywhere.
[am] really is going to flip. I can't tell her over the phone. I just have to tell her to meet me somewhere for lunch.
*Ringing*
*Ringing, Ringing*
Come on... pick up the phone mom.
[mcf]? Hey honey.
Hey mom. Where are you at right now?
I'm picking up some snacks for the house. Why? Did you need something?
Do you want to go somewhere for lunch?
Just the two of us?
Yep, just us.
Of course I do honey. You don't even have to ask that. Where do you want to go? I'll meet you there.
I'll text it to you okay?
Okay... I'll see you wherever you pick. I'm leaving the store now.
I love you mom.
I love you too. Bye honey.
All right. [am] is going to meet us somwhere, we're going to grab lunch.
Where would you like to go?
My stomach is in knots [mcf].
Yeah, mine is too.
I'll tell her to pick.
That works for me!
Are you almost ready to go?
Yep, just a few more seconds...
What do you think?
I think my sister is gorgeous.
And that dress looks great on you. It goes well with your hair.
I haven't worn a dress in so long. This one actually belongs to mom.
Let me put on my shoes and the we can leave.
A while later
Well, we're here.
And good, this place looks empty.
I'm so nervous...
Don't be. [am] is awesome.
She's really pretty.
Let me talk to her first okay? I'll tell you when to come over.
You got it.
She doesn't know I'm next to her right now...
I'll go ahead and take a seat.
Dang mom... what's she zoned out about?
Mom?
[mcf]! How long were you there?
I just now sat down.
You startled me.
Sorry mom. What were you thinking about?
I was thinking about why you wanted to have lunch.
We've only ever really done this out of nowhere when you had news to tell me.
So what's the news?
Well... sinc-
Wait! Let me guess.
Is [g1] pregnant!?
What?
Me and her have talked about things.
She told me that you two were letting things happen.
It's time for me to help raise another kid. I'm ready to be a grandma.
Mom... no. I mean we are. But that's not it.
It's about a girl that you haven't met yet.
Who?
Uhh, she has many names to me right now. But she goes by Willow.
Willow? Isn't that the girl that said mean things about [g1]?
It is, but she's apologized for it and she explained why she did it.
That's no longer a problem.
Oh my god, she's not pregnant is she?
Ha, I certainly hope not.
Come here Willow.
She's here?
Hi...
What's happening honey? I'm getting worried.
Everything's okay mom. Just hear us out.
Did you tell her?
Not yet. Willow this is [am].
Uhh... it's... it's nice to meet you...
She really is nervous.
It's nice to meet you too Willow.
Now can you two please tell me what's going on?
We do have something to tell you.
I don't want you to go crazy so you have to promise you can handle news right now.
Did you win a free vacation somewhere or something?
Tell me already honey... I promise I can handle news.
I'm just going to say it.
The girl standing next to you right now... she's my sister.
What did you say?
You heard me right mom. Willow is Cedey from my dreams.
Huh? [mcf]!
I promise mom. I wouldn't joke about anything like this.
How do you know?
We've been going through the same thing. And we have the same story as our past.
It's her mom.
Oh my god!
He's my brubru... and thank you for taking care of him.
Come here sweetie.
You have to tell me everything.
She has to tell us both.
Get in here [mcf]!
I can't believe this! You actually found her [mcf]!
I've never been hugged this much before.
Ha, get used to it. We're huggers.
I'm so happy Willow.
I am too.
If you ever need anything then you ask us okay? We're all family now.
You're a very sweet woman [am].
So we're here... what do you want to know?
Hmmm... where to start?
My memory is a little fuzzy from before you left... but I'll answer anything that I have an answer for.
Okay. Start from there. What happened after?
Dad left shortly after my accident... do you remember that?
I do... and I'm so sorry Cedey. That was all my fault.
No, it really wasn't.
But after you two left, mom was really strong for me. I was still recovering and she was there for me through it all.
It took many months to heal. Probably half a year.
She was always by my side. She gave me everything I needed.
She helped me deal with losing my brother too.
And after I recovered we decided to go to the park one day. It's actually the park that's near here.
We were enjoying our day but it was strange.
She cried a lot. But that was sort of normal.
She was telling me how much she'll always love me and how no matter what she'll always be my mom. Things like that.
So when the lady in a suit came to get me... it all made sense.
Mom didn't feel like she could raise me after that. She blamed herself for my injury.
So she gave me to the state.. and I was put in foster care.
I'm so sorry Willow.
Mom was still in my life from time to time. But never anything consistent.
I guess that explains why she never mentioned her to [am].
How did the foster home go?
Not great for me. I had put on a little weight since I was off of my feet for a long time and other kids can be cruel.
I couldn't play like all the other kids could then. My knee was still pretty bad.
I didn't really fit in with anyone so I stuck to myself.
I think that's why I am who I am now.
How did you end up here?
I worked hard. I tried to get the best grades I could... I want to be successful. I never want my kids to go through what we did.
I'm proud of you Cedey. You had it worse than me and you still made it here.
Thank you brubru... That means a fucking ton coming from you.
Language missy.
Heh, you're already getting treated like a kid by [am].
Should I get used to it?
Yes!
Can I ask something a little worse?
Yeah...
Why did dad only take me?
Uhh... I don't know.
I tried not to think about that. But I assume it's just a 'boys stay with the father' kind of thing.
I'm sorry Cedey. I shouldn't have asked.
It's okay. I'm an open book right now.
You can ask anything.
When I gave you a ride home that one morning. What happened before that?
I've been having bad dreams all week. That one was one of the worst and I just woke up outside and I was lost and scared.
I didn't know what had happened to me.
I went through the same exact thing.
Really?
Yeah, it's actually how I met Stacy and it's why I punched Ryker.
I was sleepwalking and everything too.
Wow... if only I told you about mine then...
We could have been here sooner.
I'm just happy we're here now.
Same here...
Should we sit down?
Yeah, we should.
We still have a ton to talk about.
Let's enjoy some time together before we jump back into that.
I agree we should... but first. Cedey.
I think you should come live with us.
Live with you? Like move all my stuff in?
Yeah, you're my sister. I don't want you to be alone.
[mcf], that's her decision to make. But of course she is welcome to.
It is her decision. I'm just saying how I feel about it.
Is there space for me?
Yes there is.
I mean... yeah. If it's okay with everyone.
I'm sorry for the wait guys.
Oh, hey Tia.
I didn't know she worked here.
How's it going? What can I get you guys?
I'll have a water.
That's it?
Yep, that's it.
I don't think my stomach could handle anything else right now.
I'll have a water too.
Same thing for me.
Ha, they must feel the same way I do.
Three waters?
Uhh, I'll take a coffee.
I don't plan on drinking it... but just ordering water seems wrong.
At least it's something.
Would you mind helping me carry all of it?
Uh, sure I guess.
Thank you.
Please don't try anything in here Tia... not in front of my family.
I wasn't expecting to see you today since class was cancelled.
I didn't know you worked here.
I started last week.
So uhh... have you gotten any condoms?
Tia, my mom is right behind us.
I'm being quiet.
No I haven't gotten any.
Why not?
I haven't had the chance to.
Is this your way of getting me to agree to sex without a condom?
Because it's kind of working.
I'll get some condoms Tia. When I can.
If you say so. I'll ask again soon.
So you're not into taking risks?
I never said that.
How much are you willing to risk daddy?
You can have me right now, in the back.
I don't think I'm going to buy any.
Hmmm... Does a little risk excite you daddy?
How much are you willing to risk?
You can have me right now, in the back.
Even though that sounds like fun. I can't try something like that right now.
Not with them here.
Not today Tia.
Damn... I was getting excited.
You're really teasing me up.
All of this will make it better when I do finally 'take you'.
Let's get these to your table... and then I'll see you soon yeah?
Yeah, you will.
It's why I need you to help carry some stuff. I'm not good at carrying more than a few things yet.
Well I'm happy to help.
Hey... uhh...
What happened in the showers the other day?
You don't like me?
You came on a little strong... and I just wasn't feeling it then.
It's nothing against you.
So if I tried again you might say yes?
I'm not sure. I'm here with my mom, that's just not what I'm thinking about right now.
Fair enough... I'll keep that in mind.
Let's get these to your table... and then I'll see you soon yeah?
Yeah, you will.
I hope they didn't hear any of that.
I'm so happy you're part of our family now... I love your brother so much and I'm so happy for you two.
I don't know how to explain it [am]. I don't think I've ever been as happy or hopeful as I am right now.
Hey girls.
Hey.
What do you say we take our drinks and head home?
Yeah? Are we going to tell the other girls about Willow?
We should tell them.
I'm glad you said that. There's no way I could keep this from them.
Didn't you say you were busy today?
Yeah, I actually have a lot planned still. But I can reschedule.
No, keep them. I'd need to get settled in at your place anyway.
And I wouldn't mind some alone time so I can think of everything I want to say to you.
If that's what you want Cedey.
It is.
Let's go home you two.
A few minutes later
How do you want to handle telling them?
Same way as with [am]. You tell them and I stand there.
Haha, sure.
Can I use your restroom first?
Yeah, the bathroom is in the bedroom that's on the left.
Thank you. Don't go anywhere okay?
I'll be in the living room with them.
I'm so proud of you [mcf].
How do you feel?
I feel relieved. It's such a nice feeling to know who she is and have these answers.
Just knowing my sister is safe makes me happy.
You're such a sweetheart.
And thank you for everything you said to her.
I'm sure it's making it easier on her to know that we're all happy she's here.
Of course honey. I haven't told her this yet but since she's your sister then that means she's pretty much my daughter now.
I'll at least treat her that way. I just wish I knew why your other mom didn't tell me about her.
I think I'll ask her about that.
You should... just not today. Let today be about her meeting her brother again. Don't drown her in questions right away, let her get comfortable first.
You're right mom.
Mwah!
Mwah!
Mmm..
Neither of us are pulling away.
Mmmm..
I don't know if she's waiting on me to so I'll just go ahead before it gets weird.
Heh...
Well...
That seems to have flustered her.
I'm going to go put up all of the things I bought earlier okay?
Tell me how it goes with the girls.
I will mom, if you need any help just let me know.
I will.
I hope they're not too upset with me. I'm about an hour and a half late getting home.
Hey girls.
There you are!
[mcf]! Are we still going on our date?
Of course Shauna. I like the dress you chose.
Sit down baby.
Where have you been?
Willow really needed some company so I hung out with her for a while.
Oh, she did seem really sad in the car earlier.
Is she better now?
Oh yeah, I think she's doing great now.
I expect nothing less from you at this point.
Where's the other girls?
Everyone besides Rachael and Elizabeth are out somewhere. I'm not sure where Rachael is but Elizabeth is getting ready for tonight.
Psst..
You could have called or texted us or something you know... Just to let us know you're okay.
You're right. I will next time I'm late. I promise.
Thank you.
And you said you liked my dress?
I think it looks amazing on you Shauna.
I'm glad you think so.
I spent a long time picking it out. Do you mind if I show it off for you right now?
Sure.
I just hope she doesn't go too far since Cedey could walk up any moment.
I really liked the design on it.
I like it too.
Do you want to see the other side?
Absolutely.
I told her that her ass looks amazing in that dress. Doesn't it babe?
Yes it absolutely does.
Hehe... Our date is going to be fun.
[mcf]... there's something I've always wanted to try.
What is it?
A lapdance.
Oh Shauna...
Mmmm... how does that feel babe?
It feels great but...
Later when we have some alone time. I want to give you a real one of these.
I would fucking love that Shauna. But you should stand up before anyone walks in on us.
I'm just sitting on your lap.
It's okay. I don't think anyone here would care too much if they did see us like this.
It's not like we're naked or anything.
So this is what happens here?
Willow! I didn't know you were here!
I guess [mcf] was keeping it a secret.
Is it okay that I'm here?
Yeah, we don't mind at all.
So? what's the plan?
Come sit down.
Okay...
What's happening?
You'll see in a second.
Where do I sit?
You can sit inbetween me and [mcf].
Okay, thank you Shauna.
So, now that you're all here there's something I have to tell you.
[mcf] wait...
Let me do it this time.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I want to.
[g1] and Shauna... Your boyfriend is a great guy. I've felt close to him since I met him... even though I didn't act like it.
When he took me home today I begged him to stay and keep me company because I didn't want to feel lonely and I feel better when he's around.
There's no easy way to say what I'm about to say.
While he was at my house we discovered something... we haven't pieced everything together yet but...
[mcf] is my brother. My dad took him away from me when we were kids and we somehow found eachother again.
[mcf]? Really?
Oh wow!
She's completely serious. Willow is Cedey. She's my sister.
Willow... I had no clue.
None of us did. If [mcf] didn't see me sleepwalk then we may have never known.
I was expecting you to say something totally different. Come here Willow.
Oh wow...
Oh man, I feel so warm right now. It's like a huge hole in my life was just filled.
Me and Cedey need to keep talking about things... but [am] was right when she said I shouldn't overwhelm her.
It's hard not to be tempted to though.
I never took her to be much of a hugger... but she seems to like it.
Must run in the family.
Oh yeah, she likes it... she said earlier that she's never been hugged this much before.
I'm glad she's being show the affection she deserves.
I still feel sick thinking about me causing all of this in the first place... but I should wait and see what Cedey has to say about it.
What am I missing?
Hey Rachael.
Hey kid. What's going on?
Who is the girl with pink hair?
Uhh...
That's my sister.
Haha, very funny.
I'm serious Rachael.
What?? My guys could barely find anything? How did you just straight up find her? How do you know?
Incredible luck. But yeah Rach... she's my sister. We can tell you the same exact story from both of our sides.
It's true. He's my brother. It's nice to meet you. You can call me Cedar or Willow.
Well I just have to get in on this hug now.
Is this what it feels like to be you?
Yeah, pretty much.
Haha, no wonder you're so nice.
Why aren't you in this hug babe?
Come here.
Ahh, that's better.
Is this like my initiation into the family?
You can think of it like that.
I'm happy for you baby. I never imagined you having a sister... and here we are.
It's the perfect thing to end this crazy week with.
I know right? Maybe things will slow down now that we're back as siblings.
Willow, we should show you around.
Yeah? I wouldn't mind a tour.
I'll be happy to give you one.
Thank you [g1].
While all of you do that I need to borrow [mcf] for a bit.
I have to take him somewhere.
What?
Is it cool if I leave Cedey?
I'm not thrilled about it but I have your girls to keep me company and a house to explore.
Just come find me when you have some time. I'm going to think about everything I want to tell you.
I'll do the same.
I love you brubru.
I love you too Cedey.
When I get back from whatever Rachael has to show me we'll go on our date okay?
[mcf]... you just found your sister. Our date can wait.
Wow, that's really sweet of her. But I know how much she's looked forward to this and Cedey already said it was okay.
It's okay Shauna. We'll still be going. Be ready for when I get home okay?
Yes baby, I'll be ready to go.
Mwah!
I love you.
I love you too. Look after Cedey for me okay?
I will.
Good girl. I'll see you soon.
See you baby.
I feel like I'm the only girl around this house that doesn't get kissed on a regular basis.
All you have to do is ask.
Can I have a kiss [mcf]? Pretty please?
Mwah!
Thank you.
Ha, yeah it does happen a lot...
Okay...
So what do you need me for?
We're going to go on a ride. There's a person and a place you have to meet and see.
I don't want to be rude Rachael but could this not wait until later?
It needs to happen right now, trust me. It's for the best.
Okay Rach... are you driving or am I?
I'll drive this time.
I trust Rachael but fuck... bad timing today.
If she says it's important then it likely is...
I wonder who I'm supposed to be meeting?
A few minutes later
Where are we Rachael?
A really nice house.
[mcf]... welcome to our new home.
You've had to move a lot in this week... way more than anyone should have to.
But this house will last a while. I promise.
Really? This is ours?
Fuck... I wasn't paying attention earlier, I didn't see the outside of the house.
Follow me.
Why is she showing me first?
We could have brought everyone.
It's a nice garage.
When we walk in don't go wandering off. Stay by me.
I'm sure you want to see the house... but that's not why we're here right now.
Now I'm going to need you to keep an open mind okay?
I will.
And we'll explore the house when we bring everyone else over here.
Keep following me.
That's a nice table, I wonder how big this place is?
So this door right next to the stairs will always be locked. Only me and you will have a key.
Okay...
So... there's someone living down there. We have the entire house to ourselves besides the basement.
Who is living there?
[mcf]... no one but the two of us can talk about this. Promise?
Not even to [g1] or Shauna. Nobody.
Rachael, they'll be living with us. Shouldn't they know about whoever it is?
It's not about whether they should... it's about the fact that they can't.
I'm putting all of my trust into you kid. If you went and told anyone there was someone down there you'd completely ruin my career as a fixer.
I'm doing this because I think it's the best thing to do. And I trust you.
All we have to do is tell them that this door leads to an unfinished basement and that it should stay locked.
So can you promise me that you'll never talk about who you meet down here?
Okay Rachael. I promise.
I'll go ahead and give you the other key.
Follow me.
I'm nervous. I have no clue what I'm walking into right now.
Woah, this basement is huge.
Talismah! Where'd you go?
I'm over here!
Where?
Behind the block in the middle!
This place is meant for huge people!
Come over here Tali. There's someone I want you to meet.
Coming!
Oh shit... that's the girl Rachael showed me on her phone.
Oh shit... that's the girl Rachael showed me on her phone.
Oh! Hey...
Tali this is [mcf].
It's nice to meet you Talismah.
Don't be shy...
I can talk to him?
Yes. You can talk to him as much as you'd like. You can tell him anything.
He has the other key to this place. So you can trust him just as much as you trust me.
He's really tall...
Ha, yeah... he is.
What the fuck is going on?
It's nice to meet you too.
He doesn't know who you are Tali. Is it okay if I tell him or do you want to?
You mean he doesn't know who I used to be.
You can tell him.
You're talking to a princess.
Like an actual one. She's the daughter of a king.
Wow... okay. Why is she here then?
While you tell him this I'm going to finish what I was doing.
Whew... that's a long story. I'll try to summarize it.
Well first you need to know there are many people like me all over the world. And I know very many of them personally.
Anyway, Talismah is from the other side of the world. And how she ended up here is pretty crazy.
She's the daughter of a very powerful man... a very evil man.
When she was 14 she was promised as a bride. Which she wasn't happy about.
Okay...
And one day where she lived was being attacked. Talismah was able to escape amidst everything.
That's where a friend of mine found her. And to protect her they had to get her out of there.
So she was sent to me. And I've been keeping her safe since. It's been almost 20 years since it happened.
I'll tell you the rest while you walk me out.
You're leaving?
I have to make a few calls. And I want you two to have a chance to talk without a babysitter in the room.
And I don't want Tali to hear what I'm about to say.
Hey Rach... I don't know how I feel about this.
What's wrong?
If she's being looked for... I don't feel comfortable having her around all of the girls.
Come on [mcf]. If I felt there was any chance I'd be endangering any of you. Do you think I'd do it?
Her father passed away 2 years ago. There's still a power struggle over who will take charge over there.
No one is worried about Tali right now. We're just being safe. I've hid her for 20 years, I know what I'm doing.
And we monitor everything. If we hear any word that people are looking for her then we'll take actions necessary to keep everyone safe. Don't worry.
Okay...
Is she the girl in the photos you showed me?
Yes, she doesn't know about that though
So you're setting this up?
Yes... which is strange since she's like a daughter to me.
But her life will finally be starting soon. And she's always talked about wanting a little girl.
Don't you think she should experience a few things before having a kid?
People want what they want [mcf]. Which is why I'm basically giving you my blessing to do whatever you think is right with her.
Be her friend before trying to be anything else. That's my only rule.
I know this is crazy. But you did just randomly find your sister... so maybe this seems normal in comparison.
Now properly introduce yourself. I'll be back in a few minutes, I'll explain more then.

All I'm asking is for you to be her friend. Spend some time with her when you can.

Somehow today managed to get weirder... I'm going to be living with a princess that stays in my basement.
I used to just play basketball and hang out... shit, it was only a week ago.
She seems nice. I don't mind being her friend at all... it's just everything else about it.
I have no reason to doubt Rachael... but I'm always going to worry for everyone's safety.
So... Talismah.
You can call me Tali.
Want to sit down?
Sure.
Rachael has never left me alone with anyone before.
She must really trust you.
I guess she does. So tell me about yourself Tali.
What do you want to know?
Uhh... what do you do for fun?
Uhmm. Whatever I can. There's a lot more to do here than anywhere I've been before.
I mainly just watch movies. My old place had a treadmill and I'd walk while watching them.
I play video games too.
Nice. We'll need to play sometime then.
If only Shauna could come down here. We could all play together.
How do you feel about living like this? It must suck not being able to live however you want to live.
It's really not that bad. I've always enjoyed being inside and I don't mind being alone.
I could be in a way worse place. I'm happy here.
That's a great attitude to have.
Sure I wish I could live the average life every now and then.
Just for smaller things, like owning a cell phone would be nice.
You don't have one?
No, Rachael said it was too dangerous.
How did Rachael get those pictures then?
How did Rachael get those pictures then?
I don't see many other people. Just Rachael and a few other fixers that have helped move me.
So I'm sorry if talking to me is difficult. I'm not the best at conversing.
You're doing great. I'm just wrapping my head around everything.
What's it like being that tall?
Uhh, it's not bad. It's hard for me to fit in smaller places but other than that it's a good thing.
I wonder how much taller you are than me.
She is pretty short. But I like that.
Stand up please. I want to see.
Okay.
You're the tallest person I've ever seen.
Hehe...
I've always been short. And this place is huge.
I wonder how it all looks to you compared to me.
Want to find out? Climb on my back.
Really?
Sure.
Hehe... don't drop me!
I wouldn't dare.
Oh! I'm as tall as you now!
You're one couch taller than me!
So, you don't need to get on my back then? Now that you can see from my height?
Well I still want to know what's it like to walk around being this tall.
I want to know what all I could reach.
Hah, okay. Hop on.
How?
Wrap your legs around my stomach and lean forward on my back.
Like this?
Yah, that works.
I can see even higher now! I wish it was always like this!
Just make sure you don't lean back. I don't want to drop you.
Okay.
So tell me where to go.
A few minutes later
Okay, I think that's about everything you can try and reach.
I'm going to sit you down on the pool table.
Oh wow. That was fun. What else can we do?
What else do you want to do?
I don't know. What do you usually do for fun?
There's tons of things.
Well, looks like you two are getting along.
Rachael! [mcf] is cool. Why didn't you ever let me hang out with anyone?
Well...
I hadn't known a guy like [mcf] until now.
Guys like him are super rare.
We weren't doing anything by the way. I just gave her a piggy back ride.
I know. I saw you put her down when I walked in.
So... what makes you so rare?
This is the end of the current update!
Thank you everyone for playing! I hope you enjoyed!
And thank you all for supporting me through this down month. I hope this update makes up for it some.
